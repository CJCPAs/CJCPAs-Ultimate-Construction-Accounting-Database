## 1. Why WIP Audit is Critical

### The WIP Schedule Drives Everything

| Financial Statement Item | Driven by WIP |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Contract Revenue | ✓ |
| Cost of Revenue | ✓ |
| Gross Profit | ✓ |
| Underbillings (Asset) | ✓ |
| Overbillings (Liability) | ✓ |
| Working Capital | ✓ |

**The WIP schedule affects BOTH the income statement AND balance sheet.**

---

### What Can Go Wrong

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Overstated ETC | Understated revenue, understated profit |
| Understated ETC | Overstated revenue, overstated profit |
| Unrecorded costs | Understated costs, overstated profit |
| Incorrect contract amounts | Revenue errors |
| Wrong % complete | Revenue and balance sheet errors |
| Missed loss contracts | Immediate loss not recorded |

---

### Audit Standards Requirements

**AU-C Section 540 - Auditing Accounting Estimates**

The WIP schedule contains significant estimates:
- Estimated costs to complete
- Percentage complete
- Variable consideration (change orders, claims)

**Auditor must:**
- Evaluate reasonableness of estimates
- Test data underlying estimates
- Consider management bias
- Evaluate outcomes of prior estimates

---

## 2. Understanding WIP Audit Risk

### Risk of Material Misstatement

**Inherent Risk: HIGH**

| Factor | Why High Risk |
|--------|--------------|
| Management estimates | Subjective, potential bias |
| Complex calculations | Formula errors possible |
| Multiple data sources | Integration issues |
| Judgment required | Different views reasonable |
| Incentive to overstate | Compensation, covenants, bonding |

**Control Risk: Varies**

Depends on:
- Quality of job cost system
- ETC update process
- Management review procedures
- Segregation of duties
- Contract administration

---

### Fraud Risk Considerations

**Revenue Recognition = Presumed Fraud Risk (AU-C 240)**

For construction companies, manipulating the WIP schedule is the primary way to manipulate revenue.

**Red Flags:**
- Jobs always at exactly estimated profit
- ETC = original budget minus costs incurred
- Large underbillings with no explanation
- Declining gross profit late in projects
- Aggressive revenue recognition on disputed work
- Related party contracts

---

### Significant Risks

Per AU-C 315, WIP estimates are typically a **significant risk** requiring:
- Heightened audit attention
- More persuasive audit evidence
- Testing of management's process
- Evaluation of assumptions

---

### WIP Audit Assertions

| Column | Assertion | Audit Focus |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Contract Amount | Accuracy, Existence | Contract review |
| Costs to Date | Accuracy, Completeness | Job cost testing |
| Est. to Complete | Valuation | ETC review |
| Total Est. Cost | Accuracy | Calculation |
| % Complete | Accuracy | Recalculation |
| Revenue Earned | Accuracy | Recalculation |
| Billings | Accuracy, Completeness | Billing testing |
| Over/Under | Accuracy | Recalculation |

---

### Dual-Purpose Testing

WIP testing serves multiple purposes:
1. Revenue recognition (income statement)
2. Under/over billings (balance sheet)
3. Gross profit (profitability)
4. Backlog (supplementary info)

---

## 4. Sample Selection

### Contract Selection Approaches

**Approach 1: Coverage-Based**
Select contracts to achieve X% coverage of:
- Total contract value
- Total revenue
- Total costs

**Example:**
```
Target: 70% coverage of revenue

Contract    Revenue     Cumulative    Selected?
─────────   ─────────   ──────────    ─────────
2401       $1,500,000      25%          YES
2402        1,200,000      45%          YES
2403          900,000      60%          YES
2404          750,000      73%          YES
2405          600,000      83%          Judgmental
```

---

**Approach 2: Risk-Based Selection**

| Selection Factor | Why Include |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Large contracts | Material to F/S |
| High-risk contracts | Potential issues |
| Low/declining GP% | Possible loss |
| High underbillings | Aggressive revenue |
| New contract types | Less experience |
| Near completion | Final estimate critical |
| Problem history | Prior issues |

---

**Approach 3: Combined Approach (Recommended)**

1. **All** contracts above materiality threshold
2. **Sample** of remaining based on risk
3. **Coverage** target (70-80% typical)
4. **Specific** items based on risk factors

---

### Sample Size Considerations

| Factor | More Contracts | Fewer Contracts |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Control reliance | | ✓ |
| High inherent risk | ✓ | |
| Many small jobs | | ✓ (may sample) |
| Few large jobs | ✓ (test all large) | |
| Prior issues | ✓ | |
| First year audit | ✓ | |

## 7. Testing Estimates to Complete (THE CRITICAL TEST)

### This is the Most Important WIP Audit Procedure

**Why ETC is Critical:**
- Directly affects percent complete
- Subjective management estimate
- Primary area for manipulation
- Hardest to audit

---

### ETC Testing Procedures

| Procedure | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Interview PM** | Understand job status |
| **Review supporting detail** | Evaluate estimate basis |
| **Compare to original budget** | Identify variances |
| **Analyze cost trends** | Project remaining costs |
| **Review subsequent costs** | Hindsight information |
| **Evaluate reasonableness** | Professional skepticism |
| **Consider history** | Prior estimate accuracy |

---

### Project Manager Interview

**Key Questions to Ask:**

1. What is the current status of the project?
2. What work remains to be completed?
3. Have there been any cost overruns?
4. Are there any anticipated problems?
5. How did you develop the cost to complete estimate?
6. Have there been any scope changes?
7. Is the project on schedule?
8. Are there any disputes with the owner?
9. Are subcontractors performing as expected?
10. What is your confidence level in the estimate?

Total Estimated Cost    $1,000,000    $1,020,000    $(20,000)     (2.0%)
Contract Price          $1,350,000    $1,500,000    $150,000      11.1%
Gross Profit           $  350,000    $  480,000    $130,000      37.1%
GP %                        25.9%         32.0%

Analysis:
- Total estimated costs increased 2% vs. original budget
- Contract price increased 11% due to change orders
- Net impact: GP% increased from 26% to 32%
- Change seems reasonable given approved change orders

Prior Period Comparison:
  6/30/24 GP%: 28%
  9/30/24 GP%: 30%
  12/31/24 GP%: 32%

GP% trending favorably as COs exceed cost growth

### Subsequent Events Review

**Use Hindsight Information:**

Review costs incurred after year-end (through fieldwork date):

```
Job 2401 - Subsequent Cost Analysis
Period: January 1 - February 15, 2025
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ETC at 12/31/24: $300,000

Costs incurred 1/1 - 2/15:
  January costs: $52,000
  February costs (partial): $28,000
  Total subsequent: $80,000

Remaining ETC at 2/15/25: $220,000

Analysis:
- Costs are tracking as expected
- No indication ETC was understated
- Project manager confirms on track
```

---

### Red Flags in ETC Testing

| Red Flag | Possible Issue |
|----------|---------------|
| ETC = remaining budget exactly | Not actually estimated |
| ETC unchanged for months | Estimates not updated |
| ETC decreasing faster than costs incurred | Possible understatement |
| PM cannot explain ETC | Lack of process |
| Large last-minute changes | Possible manipulation |
| No detail by category | Weak estimate basis |
| ETC inconsistent with % complete physically | Mathematical issue |

## 10. Analyzing Over/Under Billings

### Calculate Over/Under Billing

```
Revenue Earned                         $ 1,058,824
Billings to Date                          (850,000)
                                       ───────────
Underbilling (Asset)                   $   208,824
```

---

### Analyze Underbillings

**Questions for Large Underbillings:**

1. Why hasn't this been billed?
2. When will it be billed?
3. Is there a dispute?
4. Is the customer aware?
5. Are there contract restrictions?
6. Is the ETC reasonable (not understated)?

---

### Analyze Overbillings

**Questions for Large Overbillings:**

1. Is the billing schedule front-loaded?
2. Can the company complete the work?
3. Are costs properly recorded?
4. Is there repayment risk?

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Revenue Earned (recalculated)          $ 1,058,824
Billings to Date (tested)                 (850,000)
                                       ───────────
Underbilling                           $   208,824

Analysis:
- Underbilling = 24.5% of revenue earned
- Represents approximately 2 months of billing
- Last billing 12/31/24 = $15,000 (low billing in December)

Explanation per Management:
- December billing submitted late due to holidays
- January billing expected to be $150,000+
- No disputes or collection concerns

Subsequent Billing Review:
- January 2025 billing: $175,000 [verified to pay application]
- Underbilling position reduced as expected

Conclusion:
- Underbilling is temporary timing difference
- No indication of aggressive revenue recognition
- Collection appears probable

## 11. Loss Contract Evaluation

### Critical Requirement

**If Total Estimated Cost > Contract Amount, entire loss must be recognized immediately.**

### Loss Contract Testing

```
For EACH job, calculate:

  Contract Amount                      $ X,XXX,XXX
  Less: Total Estimated Cost            (X,XXX,XXX)
                                       ───────────
  Projected Gross Profit (Loss)        $ X,XXX,XXX

If NEGATIVE → LOSS CONTRACT
```

## 14. Common Audit Findings

### Finding 1: Understated ETC

**Issue:** PM estimates don't reflect actual job status

**Indicators:**
- ETC unchanged despite cost growth
- Physical completion doesn't match % complete
- Subsequent costs exceed ETC

**Impact:** Overstated revenue and profit

---

### Finding 2: Unrecorded Costs

**Issue:** Costs incurred but not recorded

**Indicators:**
- Post-YE disbursements for YE work
- Missing subcontractor accruals
- Incomplete labor accruals

**Impact:** Understated costs, overstated profit

---

### Finding 3: Loss Contracts Not Recognized

**Issue:** Expected loss not immediately recognized

**Indicators:**
- Total estimated cost > contract amount
- No loss provision recorded

**Impact:** Overstated assets, understated liability

---

### Finding 4: Unapproved COs Included

**Issue:** Unapproved change orders in contract amount

**Indicators:**
- CO included without approval
- Uncertain collection

**Impact:** Overstated revenue

---

### Finding 5: Classification Errors

**Issue:** Underbillings and overbillings netted

**Rule:** Each contract must be evaluated separately
