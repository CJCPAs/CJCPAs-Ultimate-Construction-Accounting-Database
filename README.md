## Quick Reference: Construction Accounting Equation

```
Contract Revenue Earned = (Costs Incurred to Date / Total Estimated Costs) × Total Contract Price

Gross Profit Earned = Contract Revenue Earned - Costs Incurred to Date

Overbilling = Billings to Date > Revenue Earned to Date (LIABILITY)
Underbilling = Revenue Earned to Date > Billings to Date (ASSET)
```
