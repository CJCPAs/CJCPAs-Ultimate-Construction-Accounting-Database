## 3. Mortgages Payable

### Definition
Long-term loans secured by real property:
- Office building mortgage
- Shop/warehouse mortgage
- Land loans

---

### Key Terms

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Amortization** | Period over which payments calculated (15-30 years) |
| **Term** | Actual maturity (often 5-10 years with balloon) |
| **LTV** | Loan-to-value ratio (typically 70-80%) |
| **DSCR** | Debt service coverage ratio required |

---

### Balloon Payment Consideration

Many commercial mortgages have shorter terms than amortization:
- 20-year amortization
- 5-year term (balloon)

**Classification Issue:**
If balloon payment due within 12 months, the ENTIRE remaining balance becomes current UNLESS:
- Refinancing is committed
- Company has ability and intent to refinance

---

### Journal Entries

## 4. Shareholder/Related Party Loans

### Definition
Loans from owners, shareholders, or related entities:
- Shareholder loans
- Officer loans
- Loans from affiliated companies
- Family loans

---

### Common Scenarios in Construction

| Scenario | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Working capital injection | Owner loans money when cash tight |
| Equipment purchase | Owner finances equipment purchase |
| Real estate | Owner-owned building, company pays rent/debt |
| Tax planning | Debt vs. equity considerations |

---

### Key Considerations

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Written note with terms
- Stated interest rate (or impute interest)
- Repayment schedule
- Board resolution (for corporations)

**Arm's Length Requirement:**
- Interest rate should be reasonable
- Terms should be similar to third-party lending
- IRS scrutinizes related-party transactions

**Subordination:**
- Often subordinated to bank debt
- May be required by primary lender
- Impacts classification

---

### Subordinated vs. Unsubordinated

| Type | Description | Surety View |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Subordinated** | Repayment after other creditors | Often treated like equity |
| **Unsubordinated** | Standard creditor rights | Treated as debt |

**Surety companies often want shareholder loans subordinated** and may treat subordinated debt as equity for bonding purposes.

---

## 5. Capital Lease Obligations

- Right-of-use asset recorded
- Lease liability recorded

---

### When is a Lease a Finance Lease?

**Any ONE of these criteria:**
1. Ownership transfers at end of lease
2. Bargain purchase option exists
3. Lease term is 75%+ of useful life
4. Present value of payments is 90%+ of fair value
5. Asset is specialized with no alternative use to lessor

---

### Common Finance Leases in Construction

| Equipment | Typical Structure |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Heavy equipment | $1 buyout leases |
| Trucks | Lease-to-own programs |
| Office equipment | High-residual leases |
| Real property | Sale-leaseback arrangements |

---

## 6. Deferred Income Taxes

### Definition
Temporary differences between book and tax accounting that will result in future tax payments.

---

### Common Sources in Construction

| Item | Book vs. Tax | Deferred Tax |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Depreciation | Book = Straight-line; Tax = MACRS | Deferred Tax Liability |
| Revenue recognition | Book = % complete; Tax = completed contract | Deferred Tax Liability |
| Bad debt reserve | Book = allowance; Tax = direct write-off | Deferred Tax Asset |
| Warranty reserve | Book = accrued; Tax = when paid | Deferred Tax Asset |

---

### Construction-Specific Issues

**Completed Contract Method (Tax):**
Small contractors (< $25M average revenue) may use completed contract for tax.

**Result:**
- Book income recognized over time (% complete)
- Tax income deferred until completion
- Creates deferred tax LIABILITY

**Example:**
- Book income recognized: $500,000
- Tax income recognized: $0 (project incomplete)
- Difference: $500,000
- Tax rate: 25%
- Deferred tax liability: $125,000

---

```

**When Project Completes (reversal):**
