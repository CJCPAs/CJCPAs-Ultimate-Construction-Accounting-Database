## Overview: Current Liabilities in Construction

### Why Current Liabilities Are Critical

**Cash Flow Management:**
Construction companies often have significant current liabilities because:
- Large payrolls (weekly/bi-weekly)
- Subcontractor payments due monthly
- Material purchases on account
- Retention held from subs

**Bonding and Surety:**
Sureties closely monitor current liabilities when determining bonding capacity:
- Working capital ratio
- Current ratio
- Debt-to-equity ratio

---

## 1. Accounts Payable - Trade

### Definition
Amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors for materials, labor, and services.

---

### Components

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Material Suppliers** | Lumber, concrete, steel, electrical, plumbing, etc. |
| **Subcontractors** | Work performed by subs not yet paid |
| **Equipment Rentals** | Equipment rental invoices |
| **Other Vendors** | Office supplies, utilities, services |

---

### Subcontractor Payables - Special Considerations

**Pay-When-Paid vs. Pay-If-Paid:**

| Clause | Meaning | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Pay-When-Paid | Contractor will pay sub when GC gets paid | Timing provision only |
| Pay-If-Paid | Contractor only obligated if GC gets paid | Transfer of risk to sub |

**Accounting Treatment:**
- Pay-when-paid: Record liability when work performed
- Pay-if-paid: May defer recognition (check state law)

---

### Cutoff Issues

**Critical Question:** Are all year-end payables recorded?

**Sources of Unrecorded Payables:**
1. Invoices received after year-end for work done before year-end
2. Subcontractor work completed but not yet invoiced
3. Material deliveries at year-end
4. Services performed but not invoiced

**Cutoff Procedures:**
- Review post-year-end cash disbursements
- Review post-year-end invoices
- Inquire about known commitments
- Review receiving reports

---

### Journal Entries

**Record Invoice from Vendor:**
```
Dr. Cost of Revenue - Materials (Job 101)    25,000
    Cr. Accounts Payable - Trade                    25,000
```

**Pay Vendor:**
```
Dr. Accounts Payable - Trade                25,000
    Cr. Cash                                        25,000
```

**Accrue Unrecorded Liability at Year-End:**
```
Dr. Cost of Revenue - Subcontract (Job 102)  75,000
    Cr. Accounts Payable - Trade                    75,000
```

                                     ───────────
  Total Accounts Payable             $1,250,000
```

---

## 2. Accounts Payable - Retention

### Definition
Retention withheld from subcontractors, to be paid upon completion of their work or the project.

Also called:
- Retainage Payable
- Retention Payable
- Subcontractor Retention

---

### How It Works

**Example:**
- Subcontractor bill: $100,000
- Retention @ 10%: $10,000 withheld
- Amount paid: $90,000

The $10,000 is recorded as:
```
Dr. Cost of Revenue - Subcontract       100,000
    Cr. Accounts Payable - Trade                 90,000
    Cr. Accounts Payable - Retention             10,000
```

---

### Classification: Current vs. Non-Current

| When Due | Classification |
|----------|----------------|
| Within 12 months | Current Liability |
| Beyond 12 months | Long-Term Liability |

**Practical Approach:**
Most contractors classify as current if:
- Projects typically complete within one year
- Retention is released within one year

---

### Release Timing

**Typical Retention Release:**
1. Subcontractor's work substantially complete
2. Punch list items completed
3. Lien releases obtained
4. Warranty period may apply

**Journal Entry - Release Retention:**
```
Dr. Accounts Payable - Retention         10,000
    Cr. Cash                                     10,000
```

## 3. Billings in Excess of Costs (Overbillings)

### Definition

The amount by which:
**Billings to Date** exceeds **Revenue Earned to Date**

This represents amounts billed to customers for work not yet performed. It's a **LIABILITY** - you owe performance to the customer.

Also called:
- Overbillings
- Contract Liabilities
- Billings in Excess of Costs and Estimated Earnings
- Deferred Revenue (in some contexts)

---

### The Calculation (Per Job)

```
                   Costs Incurred to Date
% Complete    =    ─────────────────────────
                   Total Estimated Costs

Revenue Earned = % Complete × Total Contract Price

Overbilling = Billings to Date - Revenue Earned
              (if positive)
```

---

### Complete Example

**Contract Details:**
- Contract Price: $1,000,000
- Total Estimated Costs: $800,000
- Costs Incurred to Date: $200,000
- Billings to Date: $350,000

**Calculation:**
| Step | Calculation | Amount |
|------|-------------|--------|
| % Complete | $200,000 / $800,000 | 25% |
| Revenue Earned | 25% × $1,000,000 | $250,000 |
| Billings to Date | Given | $350,000 |
| **Overbilling** | $350,000 - $250,000 | **$100,000** |

This $100,000 is a **LIABILITY** - the company has billed more than it has earned.

---

### Why Overbillings Happen

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Front-loaded billing | Billing schedule ahead of work |
| Mobilization payments | Upfront payments received |
| Material prepayments | Customer paid for materials not installed |
| Back-loaded costs | Most expensive work at end |
| Strategic billing | Intentional cash management |

---

### Overbillings Are NOT Bad!

**Overbillings indicate:**
- Positive cash flow from customer
- Front-loaded billing structure
- Customer is financing the work

**Too Much Overbilling Could Indicate:**
- Aggressive billing practices
- Potential future cash flow issues when billing catches up
- Possible contract disputes

**Sureties View:**
- Moderate overbillings = good cash management
- Excessive overbillings = concern about using one job's cash for another

---

### Journal Entry to Record Overbillings

**Through WIP Adjustment:**
```
Dr. Contract Revenue                     XX,XXX
    Cr. Billings in Excess of Costs              XX,XXX
```

**Or via netting:**
The WIP schedule calculates earned vs. billed. Overbillings are the result when billings > earned.

---
