## Quick Reference: Key Balance Sheet Accounts Unique to Construction

| Account | What It Is | Where It Goes |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Contract Receivables** | Amounts billed to customers for work | Current Asset |
| **Retention Receivable** | Amounts withheld by customer until completion | Current or Non-Current Asset |
| **Costs in Excess of Billings** | Underbillings - revenue earned > amounts billed | Current Asset |
| **Billings in Excess of Costs** | Overbillings - amounts billed > revenue earned | Current Liability |
| **Accounts Payable - Retention** | Amounts withheld from subs until completion | Current Liability |

## The Over/Under Billing Concept (Critical!)

### Understanding Underbillings (Asset)

**Costs and Estimated Earnings in Excess of Billings** means:
- You've EARNED more revenue than you've BILLED
- The customer OWES you money they haven't been billed for yet
- This is an ASSET - you have a right to future billings

**Causes of Underbillings:**
1. Billing cycle timing (work done but bill not sent)
2. Unbilled change order work
3. Front-loaded estimated costs (work done early is more expensive)
4. Retainage (you earned it but can't bill until completion)

---

### Understanding Overbillings (Liability)

**Billings in Excess of Costs and Estimated Earnings** means:
- You've BILLED more than you've EARNED
- You've received money for work not yet performed
- This is a LIABILITY - you owe performance to the customer

**Causes of Overbillings:**
1. Front-loaded billing schedule
2. Mobilization payments received upfront
3. Customer paid for materials not yet installed
4. Back-loaded costs (most expensive work at end)

---

### Presentation Rule: NET BY CONTRACT, NOT BY TOTALS

**WRONG:**
```
Total Underbillings:    $500,000 (Asset)
Total Overbillings:    ($300,000)(Liability)
Net:                    $200,000 (Asset)      ← INCORRECT!
```

**CORRECT:**
```
Contract A: $100,000 Underbilling  ┐
Contract B: $250,000 Underbilling  ├─→ Costs in Excess of Billings: $400,000 (Asset)
Contract C:  $50,000 Underbilling  ┘

Contract D: $150,000 Overbilling   ┐
Contract E: $100,000 Overbilling   ├─→ Billings in Excess of Costs: $300,000 (Liability)
Contract F:  $50,000 Overbilling   ┘
```

Each contract stands alone. You cannot net across contracts.
