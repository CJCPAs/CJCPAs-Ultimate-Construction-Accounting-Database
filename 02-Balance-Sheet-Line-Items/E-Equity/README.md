|-------------|------------|--------------|
| **S Corporation** | Very Common | Pass-through taxation, limited liability |
| **LLC** | Very Common | Flexibility, pass-through taxation |
| **C Corporation** | Less Common | Double taxation, but lower rates |
| **Partnership** | Common for JVs | Pass-through, joint ventures |
| **Sole Proprietorship** | Small contractors | Simple, unlimited liability |

---

### Why Entity Type Matters for Equity

| Entity | Equity Section Title | Components |
|--------|---------------------|------------|
| C Corporation | Stockholders' Equity | Stock, APIC, Retained Earnings |
| S Corporation | Stockholders' Equity | Stock, APIC, Retained Earnings |
| LLC | Members' Equity | Members' Capital |
| Partnership | Partners' Capital | Partner Capital Accounts |
| Sole Prop | Owner's Equity | Capital Account |

## 1. Common Stock

### Definition
The par value of shares issued to shareholders.

---

### Components

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Authorized Shares** | Maximum shares company CAN issue |
| **Issued Shares** | Shares actually issued |
| **Outstanding Shares** | Issued shares minus treasury shares |
| **Par Value** | Nominal value assigned to each share |
| **No Par Stock** | Stock without stated par value |

---

### Construction Companies - Typical Setup

Most construction companies are:
- Closely held (few shareholders)
- Often S corporations
- Simple capital structure
- Par value often $1 or minimal

**Example:**
- Authorized: 100,000 shares
- Issued/Outstanding: 1,000 shares
- Par Value: $1
- Common Stock balance: $1,000

---

### Journal Entries

**Initial Stock Issuance:**
```
Dr. Cash                               100,000
    Cr. Common Stock (1,000 shares × $1)         1,000
    Cr. Additional Paid-In Capital              99,000
```

**Stock Issued for Services:**
```
Dr. Compensation Expense                50,000
    Cr. Common Stock                               500
    Cr. Additional Paid-In Capital              49,500
```

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:
  Common Stock, $1 par value;
    100,000 shares authorized;
    1,000 shares issued and outstanding          $1,000
```

---

## 2. Additional Paid-In Capital

### Definition
Amount received from shareholders in excess of par value.

Also called:
- Paid-In Capital in Excess of Par
- Capital Surplus
- APIC

---

### Calculation

```
Cash Received for Stock               $100,000
Less: Par Value (1,000 × $1)            (1,000)
                                      ─────────
Additional Paid-In Capital            $ 99,000
```

  Additional Paid-In Capital                  99,000
```

---

## 3. Retained Earnings

### Definition
Cumulative net income earned by the company since inception, minus dividends/distributions.

---

### The Retained Earnings Roll-Forward

```
Beginning Retained Earnings            $500,000
  + Net Income (Current Year)           150,000
  - Dividends/Distributions             (75,000)
  + Prior Period Adjustments                  0
                                      ─────────
Ending Retained Earnings              $575,000
```

---

### Construction Company Considerations

**Retained Earnings = "Permanent Capital"**

For sureties, retained earnings represent:
- Accumulated profits
- Financial cushion
- Bonding capacity base

**Strong Retained Earnings = Better Bonding**

---

### Journal Entries

**Close Net Income to Retained Earnings (Year-End):**
```
Dr. Income Summary                     150,000
    Cr. Retained Earnings                      150,000
```

**Record Dividends:**
```
Dr. Retained Earnings                   75,000
    Cr. Dividends Payable                       75,000
```

**Pay Dividends:**
```
Dr. Dividends Payable                   75,000
    Cr. Cash                                    75,000
```

---

### Negative Retained Earnings (Deficit)

**Causes:**
- Cumulative losses exceed cumulative profits
- Large distributions exceeding earnings
- Prior period adjustments

**Presentation:**
```
Retained Earnings (Deficit)                $(125,000)
```

**Surety Impact:**
- Red flag for bonding
- May require personal guarantees
- Limits single job/aggregate limits

## 4. Distributions/Dividends

### Definition
Payments to shareholders/owners from company earnings.

---

### Types

| **Property Dividends** | Distribution of property |
| **Stock Dividends** | Additional shares issued |
| **S Corp Distributions** | Pass-through entity distributions |
| **LLC Distributions** | Member draws/distributions |

---

### S Corporation Distributions - Special Rules

**S Corps pass through income but often retain cash:**
- Shareholders pay tax on their share of income
- Company may not distribute all earnings
- Distributions reduce stock basis

**AAA Account (Accumulated Adjustments Account):**
Tracks S corp earnings available for tax-free distribution.

**Example:**
- Shareholder owns 50%
- S Corp net income: $200,000
- Shareholder's K-1 income: $100,000
- Cash distributed: $75,000

Shareholder pays tax on $100,000, but only received $75,000 cash.

## 8. S Corporation Considerations

### Overview

S Corporations are the most common structure for mid-size construction companies.

---

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pass-Through** | Income taxed at shareholder level |
| **Limited Shareholders** | Max 100 shareholders |
| **Single Class of Stock** | Only one class allowed |
| **Basis Tracking** | Shareholders track stock basis |

---

### S Corp Equity Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Common Stock** | Par value of shares |
| **APIC** | Excess over par |
| **Retained Earnings** | Cumulative earnings |
| **AAA** | Accumulated adjustments account (tax) |
| **Distributions** | Reduce AAA and basis |

---

### Distribution vs. Salary (Critical Issue)

**IRS Scrutiny:**
S Corp shareholders who work in the business must take "reasonable compensation."

**Common Mistake:**
Taking all income as distributions to avoid payroll taxes.

**Proper Approach:**
- Pay reasonable salary (subject to payroll taxes)
- Distribute remaining profits (not subject to payroll taxes)

**Example:**
- S Corp income: $300,000
- Reasonable salary: $150,000 (payroll taxes apply)
- Distribution: $100,000 (no payroll taxes)
- Retained: $50,000

---

### Journal Entry - S Corp Shareholder Salary

**Record Salary:**
```
Dr. Officer Salary Expense             150,000
    Cr. Payroll Liabilities                    30,000
    Cr. Cash                                  120,000
```

**Distribution:**
```
Dr. Distributions                      100,000
    Cr. Cash                                  100,000
```

---

### Balance Sheet Presentation (S Corp)

```
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:
  Common Stock, $1 par value;
    10,000 shares authorized;
    1,000 shares issued and outstanding      $  1,000
  Additional Paid-In Capital                    9,000
  Retained Earnings                           490,000
                                          ──────────
  Total Stockholders' Equity                $500,000
```

---

## Equity Considerations for Bonding

### What Sureties Look At

| Factor | Surety Perspective |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Total Equity** | Base for bonding capacity |
| **Retained Earnings Trend** | Growing = good; Declining = concern |
| **Distributions** | Excessive distributions reduce capacity |
| **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** | Lower is better |
| **Working Capital** | Must support backlog |

---

### Equity "Rules of Thumb" for Bonding

| Metric | Typical Requirement |
|--------|-------------------|
| Single Job Limit | 10× equity |
| Aggregate Program | 15-20× equity |
| Debt-to-Equity | < 3:1 |
| Working Capital | 5-10% of backlog |

**Example:**
- Stockholders' Equity: $1,000,000
- Single Job Limit: ~$10,000,000
- Aggregate Program: ~$15,000,000-$20,000,000

---

### Impact of Distributions on Bonding

**Scenario:**
```
Beginning Equity          $1,000,000
Net Income                   300,000
Distributions               (400,000)
                          ───────────
Ending Equity             $  900,000
```

**Problem:**
- Equity DECREASED despite profitable year
- Bonding capacity REDUCED
- Surety may have concerns

**Better Approach:**
- Retain more earnings
- Limit distributions to tax liability needs
- Build equity for bonding capacity

---

## Summary: Equity Key Points

| Topic | Key Takeaway |
|-------|--------------|
| Entity Type | Determines equity presentation |
| Common Stock | Usually minimal amount |
| Retained Earnings | Key driver of bonding capacity |
| Distributions | Must balance tax needs vs. bonding |
| Treasury Stock | Contra-equity account |
| S Corp Issues | Reasonable salary requirement |
