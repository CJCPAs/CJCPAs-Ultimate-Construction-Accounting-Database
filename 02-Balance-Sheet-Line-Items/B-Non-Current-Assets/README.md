## Overview: Construction Company Fixed Assets

### Why Fixed Assets Matter in Construction

Construction companies are typically **capital-intensive** businesses with significant investments in:
- Heavy equipment (excavators, cranes, loaders)
- Transportation (trucks, trailers, vehicles)
- Support equipment (scaffolding, forms, tools)
- Real property (offices, yards, shops)

**Key Metrics:**
- Fixed asset turnover ratio
- Equipment utilization rates
- Age of fleet
- Capital expenditure requirements

---

## 1. Land

### Definition
Real property owned by the company, NOT held for sale to customers.

### Types of Land in Construction Companies

| Type | Description | Accounting |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Office/Shop Land | Land under company buildings | Non-depreciable |
| Equipment Yard | Land used for equipment storage | Non-depreciable |
| Material Yard | Land for storing materials/aggregate | Non-depreciable |
| Investment Land | Land held for appreciation | Non-depreciable |

**NOT Included Here:**
- Land held for development and sale → Inventory
- Land purchased for specific contract → Job Cost

## 2. Buildings

### Definition

### Capitalization Rules

**Capitalize:**

- Initial improvements to make usable
- Major renovations/additions

**Expense:**

- Minor repairs

---

### Depreciation

| Building Type | Useful Life | Method |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Commercial Building | 39 years | Straight-line |
| Residential Rental | 27.5 years | Straight-line |
| Land Improvements | 15 years | Straight-line or accelerated |

**Example - Annual Depreciation:**
Building Cost: $780,000
Land Value: $0 (separated)
Useful Life: 39 years
Annual Depreciation: $780,000 / 39 = $20,000

---

### Journal Entries

    Cr. Cash / Mortgage Payable               1,000,000
```

---

### Capitalization vs. Expense

**Capitalize:**
- Purchase price

### Depreciation Methods

| Method | Best For | Tax Treatment |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Straight-Line | Book purposes, simple | Allowed |
| MACRS | Tax purposes | Required for tax |
| Units of Production | High-use equipment | Allowed |
| Declining Balance | Accelerated depreciation | Allowed |

**Typical Useful Lives (Book):**
| Equipment Type | Useful Life |
|----------------|-------------|
| Heavy Equipment | 5-10 years |
| Light Equipment | 3-7 years |
| Small Tools | 1-3 years or expense |

**MACRS Lives (Tax):**
| Equipment | MACRS Class |
|-----------|-------------|
| Most construction equipment | 5 years |
| Some heavy equipment | 7 years |

---

### Example: Excavator Depreciation

**Facts:**
- Cost: $300,000
- Salvage Value: $30,000
- Useful Life: 6 years

**Straight-Line:**
Annual Depreciation = ($300,000 - $30,000) / 6 = $45,000/year

**Double Declining Balance:**
Year 1: $300,000 × (2/6) = $100,000
Year 2: ($300,000 - $100,000) × (2/6) = $66,667
And so on...

---

### Equipment Accounting Decision: Own vs. Charge to Jobs

**Option 1: Department Overhead**
All equipment costs stay in G&A/overhead, allocated to jobs through indirect cost allocation.

**Option 2: Direct Job Charging**
Equipment usage charged directly to jobs:
```
Dr. Cost of Revenue - Equipment (Job 101)    5,000
    Cr. Equipment Revenue (internal)                  5,000
```

**Option 3: Equipment Division**
Separate profit center "rents" equipment to jobs at market rates.
