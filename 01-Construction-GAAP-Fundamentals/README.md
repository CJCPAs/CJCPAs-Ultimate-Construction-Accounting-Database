## Why Construction Accounting is Different

### The Fundamental Challenge

Most businesses recognize revenue at a **point in time** (when goods are delivered or services completed). Construction companies are different:

- Projects span **multiple accounting periods** (often years)
- Revenue must be recognized **over time** as work progresses
- Requires **estimation** of costs to complete
- Financial statements depend heavily on **management judgment**

### The Long-Term Contract Problem

**Example:** A contractor signs a $10 million contract in Year 1, completes work in Years 1-3, but doesn't get final payment until Year 4.

**Without over-time recognition:**
- Year 1: $0 revenue, but incurring costs (huge loss)
- Year 2: $0 revenue, but incurring costs (huge loss)
- Year 3: $10 million revenue (massive profit)
- Year 4: $0 revenue

This **doesn't reflect economic reality**. The contractor is creating value throughout the project.

### The Solution: Over-Time Revenue Recognition

Construction revenue is recognized **over time** because the customer (typically) controls the asset being created throughout construction. The contractor can't redirect the partially completed building to another customer.

---

## Revenue Recognition Under ASC 606

### The Five-Step Model Applied to Construction

#### Step 1: Identify the Contract

**A contract exists when ALL of the following are met:**

| Criteria | Construction Application |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Parties have approved the contract | Signed construction contract or letter of intent |
| Rights are identifiable | Scope of work is defined |
| Payment terms are identifiable | Contract price, progress billing terms |
| Contract has commercial substance | Work will be performed |
| Collection is probable | Customer creditworthiness assessed |

**Watch Out For:**
- Verbal agreements (may still be contracts!)
- Letters of intent (evaluate substance)
- Contracts signed but work hasn't started
- Contracts where collectibility is uncertain

---

#### Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations

**Performance Obligation Definition:** A promise to transfer a distinct good or service.

**In Construction - Common Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Single or Multiple Performance Obligations? |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| General contractor builds entire building | Typically ONE performance obligation |
| Design-build contract | Usually ONE (design + build are integrated) |
| Contractor provides building + 1-year maintenance | Potentially TWO (building + maintenance) |
| EPC contract (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) | Usually ONE (highly integrated) |

**The "Distinct" Test:**

A good or service is distinct if BOTH:
1. **Capable of being distinct:** Customer can benefit from it on its own
2. **Distinct in context:** Not highly interrelated with other promises

**Why most construction contracts = ONE performance obligation:**
- The contractor provides a significant integration service
- The goods/services are highly interrelated
- The customer contracted for a combined output (the finished project)

---

#### Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price

**Transaction Price = The amount the contractor expects to receive**

**Components in Construction:**

| Component | Description | Treatment |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Fixed Price** | The base contract amount | Include in transaction price |
| **Cost-Plus Fee** | Reimbursable costs + markup | Include in transaction price |
| **Time & Materials** | Labor rates × hours + materials | Include in transaction price |
| **Change Orders (Approved)** | Formal modifications | Include when approved |
| **Change Orders (Unapproved)** | Pending modifications | Variable consideration |
| **Claims** | Disputes/extras not yet approved | Variable consideration |
| **Incentive Bonuses** | Early completion, safety bonuses | Variable consideration |
| **Penalties** | Liquidated damages, late penalties | Variable consideration |
| **Retainage** | Amount withheld until completion | Include (it's not variable) |

**Variable Consideration - Critical Concept:**

Variable consideration must be **estimated** and included in the transaction price, subject to the **constraint**.

---

#### Step 4: Allocate Transaction Price to Performance Obligations

**If only ONE performance obligation:** No allocation needed (most construction contracts)

**If MULTIPLE performance obligations:** Allocate based on **standalone selling prices**

**Example - Building + Maintenance Contract:**

| Performance Obligation | Standalone Price | Allocation % | Transaction Price ($1M) |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Building Construction | $900,000 | 90% | $900,000 |
| 1-Year Maintenance | $100,000 | 10% | $100,000 |
| **Total** | **$1,000,000** | **100%** | **$1,000,000** |

---

#### Step 5: Recognize Revenue When Performance Obligations are Satisfied

**Over Time Recognition (Typical for Construction):**

Revenue is recognized over time if ANY of these criteria are met:

| Criterion | Application to Construction |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits | Rarely applies to construction |
| Contractor's performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls | **MOST COMMON** - Building on customer's land |
| Contractor's performance doesn't create an asset with alternative use AND contractor has right to payment for performance to date | Custom construction with termination for convenience clauses |

**Point in Time Recognition (Rare in Construction):**

Used when:
- Building spec homes (not contracted with buyer)
- Prefabricated structures before delivery
- Custom manufacturing before delivery and transfer of control

---

## The Input Method (Percentage of Completion)

### The Most Common Method for Construction Revenue

**Basic Formula:**

```
                     Costs Incurred to Date
Percent Complete = ─────────────────────────── × 100
                   Total Estimated Costs
```

**Revenue Recognition Formula:**

```
Revenue to Recognize = Percent Complete × Total Contract Price

Current Period Revenue = Revenue to Recognize - Revenue Previously Recognized
```

---

### Complete Example - Multi-Year Project

**Contract Information:**
- Contract Price: $10,000,000
- Estimated Total Costs: $8,000,000
- Expected Gross Profit: $2,000,000
- Project Duration: 3 years

**Year 1:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Costs Incurred Year 1 | $2,400,000 |
| Total Estimated Costs | $8,000,000 |
| Percent Complete | 30% ($2.4M / $8M) |
| Revenue Earned Year 1 | $3,000,000 (30% × $10M) |
| Gross Profit Year 1 | $600,000 ($3M - $2.4M) |

**Year 2:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Costs Incurred Year 2 | $3,200,000 |
| Cumulative Costs | $5,600,000 |
| **Revised** Total Estimated Costs | $8,500,000 (cost overrun!) |
| Percent Complete | 65.88% ($5.6M / $8.5M) |
| Cumulative Revenue | $6,588,000 (65.88% × $10M) |
| Revenue Year 2 | $3,588,000 ($6,588,000 - $3,000,000) |
| Gross Profit Year 2 | $388,000 ($3,588,000 - $3,200,000) |

**Year 3:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Costs Incurred Year 3 | $2,700,000 |
| Total Actual Costs | $8,300,000 |
| Percent Complete | 100% |
| Total Revenue | $10,000,000 |
| Revenue Year 3 | $3,412,000 ($10M - $6,588,000) |
| Gross Profit Year 3 | $712,000 ($3,412,000 - $2,700,000) |

**Project Summary:**
| Year | Revenue | Costs | Gross Profit | GP % |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|------|
| 1 | $3,000,000 | $2,400,000 | $600,000 | 20.0% |
| 2 | $3,588,000 | $3,200,000 | $388,000 | 10.8% |
| 3 | $3,412,000 | $2,700,000 | $712,000 | 20.9% |
| **Total** | **$10,000,000** | **$8,300,000** | **$1,700,000** | **17.0%** |

---

### Costs to Include in Percent Complete Calculation

**Include (Direct Costs):**
- Direct labor (field workers)
- Materials installed
- Subcontractor costs
- Equipment rental for project
- Project supervision
- Direct job-related insurance
- Project-specific permits

**Exclude:**
- Uninstalled materials (unless specifically fabricated)
- General & Administrative expenses
- Selling expenses
- Abnormal waste/spoilage
- Start-up costs for new projects

---

### The Uninstalled Materials Problem

**Scenario:** Contractor purchases $500,000 of HVAC equipment, but it's sitting in the warehouse at year-end.

**WRONG Approach:** Include $500,000 in costs incurred → artificially inflates percent complete

**CORRECT Approach - ASC 606-10-55-21:**

For materials that are significant and purchased in advance:
- Recognize revenue **equal to cost** (zero profit margin)
- Don't include in percent complete calculation
- Recognize remaining profit when installed

**Journal Entry at Material Purchase:**
```
Dr. Revenue (at cost)                    500,000
    Cr. Cost of Revenue                           500,000
```

This keeps gross profit at zero for uninstalled materials.

---

## The Output Method

### Alternative to Input Method

**Output methods recognize revenue based on:**
- Units delivered
- Units produced
- Milestones achieved
- Surveys of work performed

**When to Use Output Methods:**

| Situation | Recommended Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Costs don't accurately measure progress | Output method |
| Milestone payments reflect work done | Output method |
| Unit price contracts | Output method |
| Standard input method works well | Input method (cost-to-cost) |

**Example - Unit Price Contract:**

Contract: Pave 100,000 square feet of parking lot @ $5/sq ft = $500,000 total

Year 1: 60,000 sq ft completed
- Revenue = 60,000 × $5 = $300,000
- Percent complete = 60%

---

## Contract Modifications & Change Orders

### Types of Contract Modifications

| Type | Description | Accounting |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Approved Change Order** | Formally approved by customer | Add to transaction price |
| **Unapproved Change Order** | Submitted but not yet approved | Variable consideration |
| **Claims** | Disputes, extras due to customer issues | Variable consideration |
| **Contract Options** | Future work at customer's option | Usually separate contract |

### Accounting for Change Orders

**Approved Change Orders:**

Treat as either:
1. **Separate contract** (if distinct and at standalone selling price)
2. **Modification of existing contract** (most common in construction)

**Example - Approved Change Order:**

Original contract: $1,000,000
Approved change order: $150,000
New contract price: $1,150,000

The change order costs are added to total estimated costs, and the new contract price is used going forward.

---

**Unapproved Change Orders:**

Use **variable consideration** guidance:
1. Estimate the amount expected to be received
2. Apply the constraint (only include if "highly probable" no significant reversal)
3. Update estimate each period

**Example - Unapproved Change Order:**

Contractor believes they're owed $100,000 for extra work due to design changes. Customer hasn't approved.

**Analysis:**
- Similar change orders historically approved: 80% of time
- Management estimates likely recovery: $80,000
- Constraint: Is it highly probable no significant reversal?

If YES → Include $80,000 in transaction price
If NO → Include $0 and disclose

---

### Claims

**A claim arises from:**
- Customer-caused delays
- Design errors by customer's architect
- Differing site conditions
- Third-party interference
- Acceleration requests

**Recognition Requirements (more stringent than regular variable consideration):**

To include a claim in the transaction price:
1. Reasonable basis for the claim
2. Amount can be estimated reliably
3. Evidence supports the claim
4. It's highly probable collection will occur

**Journal Entry When Claim is Recognized:**
```
Dr. Accounts Receivable - Claims              XX
    Cr. Contract Revenue                           XX
```

---

## Variable Consideration & The Constraint

### Variable Consideration in Construction

**Common Sources:**
- Incentive bonuses (early completion)
- Penalty clauses (late completion)
- Award fees (safety, quality)
- Unapproved change orders
- Claims

### Two Methods for Estimating

| Method | Best Used When |
|--------|----------------|
| **Expected Value** | Large number of similar outcomes |
| **Most Likely Amount** | Two possible outcomes (binary) |

**Example - Incentive Bonus:**

Contract includes $200,000 bonus for completing 30 days early.

Based on experience:
- 70% probability of earning full bonus
- 20% probability of earning $100,000 (15 days early)
- 10% probability of no bonus

**Expected Value:** (70% × $200K) + (20% × $100K) + (10% × $0) = $160,000

---

### The Constraint

**Rule:** Include variable consideration ONLY to the extent it's "highly probable" that a significant reversal won't occur.

**Factors increasing uncertainty:**
- Amount highly susceptible to external factors
- Uncertainty not expected to resolve for long time
- Limited experience with similar contracts
- Practice of offering price concessions

**Practical Application:**

| Scenario | Include? |
|----------|----------|
| Incentive bonus contractor has earned historically 95% of time | Yes |
| Penalty that's been waived 80% of time historically | Probably |
| Claim with no legal basis, hoping customer pays | No |
| Approved change order | Yes (not variable) |
| Unapproved change order with strong legal basis | Maybe |

---

## Loss Contracts

### When Total Estimated Costs > Contract Price

**Requirement:** Recognize the ENTIRE loss immediately, even if project just started.

**Example - Loss Contract:**

| Item | Original | Revised |
|------|----------|---------|
| Contract Price | $1,000,000 | $1,000,000 |
| Total Estimated Costs | $900,000 | $1,100,000 |
| Expected Profit/(Loss) | $100,000 | ($100,000) |

At the point the loss is identified:

**Journal Entry:**
```
Dr. Loss on Construction Contracts           100,000
    Cr. Estimated Loss on Uncompleted Contracts       100,000
```

The credit creates a **liability** for the expected loss.

---

### Ongoing Recognition for Loss Contracts

After recognizing the loss:
1. Continue recognizing revenue based on percent complete
2. Cost of revenue = Revenue recognized (zero gross profit going forward)
3. The initial loss provision absorbs the excess costs

**Example Continuation:**

Project at 50% complete when loss identified.
- Revenue earned to date: $500,000
- Costs incurred to date: $550,000 (actual)
- Loss recognized: $100,000

Going forward, revenue and costs will offset (the $100,000 loss provision covers the gap).

---

## Contract Costs (ASC 340-40)

### Costs to Obtain a Contract

**Definition:** Incremental costs to obtain a contract that wouldn't have been incurred otherwise.

| Cost Type | Capitalize or Expense? |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Sales commissions (if paid only when contract won) | Capitalize if > 1 year benefit |
| Bid costs (design, estimating for bid) | Expense as incurred |
| General selling/marketing | Expense as incurred |
| Legal fees for contract | Typically expense |

**Practical Expedient:** If amortization period < 1 year, may expense immediately.

---

### Costs to Fulfill a Contract

**Capitalize if ALL of these are met:**
1. Costs relate directly to a specific contract
2. Costs generate or enhance resources used to satisfy performance obligations
3. Costs are expected to be recovered

**Examples in Construction:**

| Cost | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| Mobilization costs | Capitalize, amortize over project |
| Pre-construction engineering | Capitalize if specific to contract |
| Site setup costs | Capitalize, amortize over project |
| Training for specific project | Capitalize |
| General training | Expense |

---

## Combining & Segmenting Contracts

### Combining Contracts

**Combine multiple contracts if:**
- Negotiated as a package with single commercial objective
- Amount paid in one contract depends on another
- Goods/services are a single performance obligation

**Example:** Three contracts signed same day for same project:
- Foundation contract
- Shell/structure contract
- Finish contract

If negotiated together and pricing is interrelated → COMBINE

---

### Segmenting a Contract

**Segment a single contract if:**
- Multiple distinct performance obligations exist
- Each has a standalone selling price
- Customer can benefit from each separately

**Rare in Construction** because most construction services are:
- Highly integrated
- Customized significantly
- Part of a combined output

---

## Key Journal Entries

### Basic Construction Accounting Entries

**1. Costs Incurred:**
```
Dr. Construction in Progress (WIP Asset)      XXX
    Cr. Accounts Payable / Cash                    XXX
```

**2. Billings to Customer:**
```
Dr. Accounts Receivable                       XXX
    Cr. Billings on Construction Contracts         XXX
```

**3. Revenue Recognition (End of Period):**
```
Dr. Cost of Construction                      XXX
Dr. Construction in Progress (Gross Profit)   XXX
    Cr. Revenue from Construction Contracts        XXX
```

**4. Cash Collections:**
```
Dr. Cash                                      XXX
    Cr. Accounts Receivable                        XXX
```

**5. Project Completion:**
```
Dr. Billings on Construction Contracts        XXX
    Cr. Construction in Progress                   XXX
```

---

### Alternative Method (More Common in Practice)

Many contractors use a simpler approach:

**1. Costs Incurred:**
```
Dr. Cost of Revenue (by job)                  XXX
    Cr. Accounts Payable / Cash                    XXX
```

**2. Billings:**
```
Dr. Accounts Receivable                       XXX
    Cr. Billings (per job - not revenue yet)       XXX
```

**3. Revenue Recognition (via WIP adjustment):**
```
Dr. Costs in Excess of Billings               XXX
    Cr. Revenue                                    XXX
    (If underbilled)

OR

Dr. Revenue                                   XXX
    Cr. Billings in Excess of Costs                XXX
    (If overbilled - recording revenue earned)
```

The WIP schedule then calculates the proper over/under billing positions.

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

1. **Construction revenue is recognized OVER TIME** because the customer controls the asset during construction

2. **The Input Method (Cost-to-Cost)** is most common:
   - Percent Complete = Costs to Date / Total Estimated Costs

3. **Estimates matter enormously** - small changes in estimated costs to complete significantly impact reported profit

4. **Variable consideration** (change orders, claims) requires careful evaluation against the constraint

5. **Loss contracts** require immediate full recognition of the loss

6. **The WIP schedule** is the key document that drives revenue recognition
