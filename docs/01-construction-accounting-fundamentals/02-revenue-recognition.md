# Revenue Recognition in Construction

## ASC 606 Overview for Construction

Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, provides the framework for recognizing revenue from construction contracts. This standard applies to all construction contracts entered into or modified after December 15, 2017 (public companies) or December 15, 2018 (private companies).

## The Five-Step Model

### Step 1: Identify the Contract

A contract exists when:
1. The parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform
2. Rights of each party are identifiable
3. Payment terms are identifiable
4. The contract has commercial substance
5. Collection is probable

**Construction-Specific Considerations:**
- Verbal agreements may constitute contracts
- Letters of intent may require revenue recognition
- Contract modifications (change orders) require careful analysis
- Master service agreements vs. individual work orders

### Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations

A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service.

**Single Performance Obligation:**
Most construction contracts are treated as a single performance obligation because:
- The contractor provides a significant integration service
- The outputs are highly interdependent
- The customer contracted for a combined output (the completed project)

**Multiple Performance Obligations May Exist When:**
- Design services are separable from construction
- Multiple buildings with independent functionality
- Equipment installation separate from construction

### Step 3: Determine the Transaction Price

The transaction price is the amount the contractor expects to receive.

**Components of Transaction Price:**
| Component | Treatment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Fixed consideration | Include in transaction price |
| Variable consideration | Estimate and include if highly probable |
| Change orders | Include when approved or highly probable |
| Claims | Include when resolved or highly probable |
| Incentive bonuses | Include using most likely amount or expected value |
| Liquidated damages | Reduce transaction price based on probability |

**Constraining Variable Consideration:**
Include variable consideration only to the extent it is probable a significant revenue reversal will not occur.

Factors indicating constraint:
- Amount highly susceptible to external factors
- Long period before uncertainty resolved
- Limited experience with similar contracts
- Broad range of possible outcomes

### Step 4: Allocate Transaction Price

If multiple performance obligations exist, allocate based on:
1. **Standalone selling price (best evidence)**
2. **Expected cost plus margin approach**
3. **Residual approach (limited circumstances)**

For most construction contracts with a single performance obligation, allocation is not necessary.

### Step 5: Recognize Revenue

Revenue is recognized when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied.

**Over Time Recognition (Most Construction Contracts):**
Revenue recognized over time if ANY criteria met:
1. Customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits
2. Contractor's performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls
3. **Contractor's performance does not create an asset with alternative use AND contractor has enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date**

Most construction contracts meet criteria 3:
- Building on customer's land (no alternative use)
- Payment terms include progress billing and termination for convenience clauses

## Measuring Progress

### Input Methods

**Cost-to-Cost (Percentage of Completion):**
Most common method in construction.

```
Percent Complete = Actual Costs to Date / Total Estimated Costs at Completion

Revenue to Date = Percent Complete × Total Contract Price

Current Period Revenue = Revenue to Date - Revenue Previously Recognized
```

**Example Calculation:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Contract Price | $10,000,000 |
| Costs Incurred to Date | $6,000,000 |
| Estimated Costs to Complete | $2,500,000 |
| Total Estimated Costs | $8,500,000 |
| Percent Complete | 70.59% ($6M / $8.5M) |
| Revenue to Date | $7,059,000 |
| Gross Profit to Date | $1,059,000 |

**Labor Hours or Labor Dollars:**
Alternative input method when labor represents significant portion of costs.

### Output Methods

**Units Delivered:**
Appropriate when:
- Contract is for discrete units (e.g., 100 single-family homes)
- Each unit represents approximately equal effort
- Units have standalone value

**Surveys of Work Performed:**
- Physical inspection of work completed
- Engineer's estimates
- Milestone achievement

**Right to Invoice:**
Practical expedient when:
- Right to invoice equals value delivered
- Invoice amount corresponds directly to value provided

## Contract Assets and Liabilities

### Contract Assets (Underbillings)

When costs incurred plus recognized profit exceed billings:

```
Contract Asset = (Costs Incurred + Gross Profit Recognized) - Billings to Date
```

**Journal Entry:**
```
Dr. Contract Asset (Costs in Excess of Billings)    XXX
    Cr. Contract Revenue                                     XXX
```

### Contract Liabilities (Overbillings)

When billings exceed costs incurred plus recognized profit:

```
Contract Liability = Billings to Date - (Costs Incurred + Gross Profit Recognized)
```

**Journal Entry:**
```
Dr. Cash/Accounts Receivable    XXX
    Cr. Contract Liability (Billings in Excess of Costs)    XXX
```

### Presentation Requirements

Per ASC 606:
- Contract assets and liabilities presented net at the contract level
- Offset across contracts not permitted
- Separate line items on balance sheet OR
- Disclosed in notes if combined with other items

## Change Orders and Modifications

### Types of Contract Modifications

1. **Approved Change Orders:** Written, priced, and approved by owner
2. **Pending Change Orders:** Submitted but not yet approved
3. **Claims:** Amounts in excess of contract price seeking recovery

### Accounting Treatment

| Scenario | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| Approved change order | Include in contract price immediately |
| Pending - highly probable | Include in variable consideration |
| Pending - not probable | Do not include until approved |
| Claims | Include only if enforceable right and amount estimable |

### Modification Types per ASC 606

**Separate Contract:**
When modification adds distinct goods/services at standalone selling price.

**Cumulative Catch-Up:**
When modification changes scope but not distinct - remeasure progress.

**Prospective Treatment:**
When modification adds distinct goods/services but not at standalone price.

## Loss Contracts

### Identifying Loss Contracts

A contract is onerous when total estimated costs exceed the transaction price.

**Review Triggers:**
- Significant cost overruns
- Schedule delays
- Design changes
- Material price increases
- Labor shortages

### Accounting for Losses

**Loss Recognition:**
Recognize entire estimated loss immediately when identified.

```
Estimated Loss = Total Estimated Costs - Transaction Price
```

**Journal Entry for Loss:**
```
Dr. Loss on Construction Contract           XXX
    Cr. Provision for Loss on Contract           XXX
```

**Example:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Contract Price | $5,000,000 |
| Costs to Date | $3,500,000 |
| Estimated Costs to Complete | $2,000,000 |
| Total Estimated Costs | $5,500,000 |
| Estimated Loss | ($500,000) |
| Costs to Date / Total Costs | 63.64% |
| Revenue to Recognize | $3,500,000 (limited to costs) |
| Loss Recognized to Date | $500,000 |

## Disclosure Requirements

### Qualitative Disclosures
1. Nature, amount, timing of revenue and cash flows
2. Performance obligations - when satisfied, payment terms
3. Significant judgments - variable consideration, constraint
4. Methods used to recognize revenue

### Quantitative Disclosures
1. Disaggregation of revenue by:
   - Type of contract (fixed-price, cost-plus)
   - Geography
   - Market (public, private)
   - Contract duration
   
2. Contract balances:
   - Opening and closing contract assets
   - Opening and closing contract liabilities
   - Revenue recognized from beginning liabilities
   - Changes due to business combinations, impairment

3. Remaining performance obligations:
   - Aggregate amount
   - Expected timing of satisfaction
   - Practical expedient elections

## Practical Expedients

### Financing Component
May ignore financing component if:
- Contract duration ≤ 1 year, or
- Payment terms customary in the industry

### Costs to Obtain Contract
May expense if amortization period ≤ 1 year

### Completed Contracts
May use completed contract method if:
- Short-duration contracts
- Results similar to over-time method

### Right to Invoice
May recognize revenue equal to invoice amount when:
- Right to invoice equals value delivered
- Contractor has enforceable right to payment

## Common Implementation Issues

### Issue 1: Estimating Costs to Complete
- Requires significant judgment
- Should be reviewed and updated monthly
- Document basis for estimates
- Consider contingencies

### Issue 2: Uninstalled Materials
- Generally exclude from percent complete calculation
- Unless materials are fabricated specifically for project
- Or materials are significant portion of total costs

### Issue 3: Front-Loaded Profit
- Input methods may recognize profit before work performed
- Consider if pattern reflects transfer of control
- Adjust method if significant distortion

### Issue 4: Series Guidance
- Multiple promised goods/services may be single obligation
- If substantially same AND same pattern of transfer
- Common in repetitive construction (multiple buildings)
