# Construction Accounting Overview

## Introduction

Construction accounting is a specialized form of project accounting that tracks, records, and reports on all financial aspects of construction projects. It differs significantly from standard accounting due to the long-term nature of construction contracts, the complexity of cost estimation, and unique revenue recognition requirements.

## Key Characteristics of Construction Accounting

### 1. Project-Based Accounting
Unlike manufacturing or retail businesses, construction companies organize their accounting around individual projects (jobs). Each project has:
- Unique contract terms
- Separate cost tracking
- Individual profit margins
- Specific timelines

### 2. Long-Term Contracts
Construction contracts often span multiple accounting periods, requiring:
- Revenue recognition over time
- Periodic cost and profit estimation
- Work-in-progress tracking
- Contract asset and liability management

### 3. Complex Cost Estimation
Accurate cost estimation is critical and includes:
- Direct labor costs
- Materials and supplies
- Equipment costs
- Subcontractor costs
- Overhead allocation
- Contingencies

## Fundamental Accounting Concepts

### Job Costing
Every cost must be assigned to a specific job. This includes:
- **Direct costs**: Labor, materials, subcontractors, equipment
- **Indirect costs**: Allocated overhead, supervision

### Cost Codes
A systematic cost coding structure enables:
- Detailed cost tracking by category
- Comparison to estimates
- Historical data for future bidding

Example Cost Code Structure:
```
Job Number - Cost Category - Cost Type
1001-01-100: Job 1001, Site Work, Direct Labor
1001-01-200: Job 1001, Site Work, Materials
1001-02-100: Job 1001, Concrete, Direct Labor
```

### Percentage of Completion
The primary method for recognizing revenue over time:
```
% Complete = Costs Incurred to Date / Total Estimated Costs
Revenue Recognized = % Complete × Total Contract Price
```

### Billings vs. Costs
The relationship between billings and costs determines:
- **Underbillings (Asset)**: Costs + Profit > Billings
- **Overbillings (Liability)**: Billings > Costs + Profit

## Financial Statement Presentation

### Balance Sheet Unique Items
1. **Contract Assets (Underbillings)**: Costs and recognized profits exceeding billings
2. **Contract Liabilities (Overbillings)**: Billings exceeding costs and recognized profits
3. **Retainage Receivable**: Amounts withheld by customers
4. **Retainage Payable**: Amounts withheld from subcontractors

### Income Statement Considerations
1. **Gross Profit by Job**: Critical metric for construction
2. **Overhead Allocation**: May be included in cost of revenue or separate
3. **Equipment Income/Expense**: Internal equipment charges

### Required Disclosures
Under ASC 606, construction companies must disclose:
1. Disaggregation of revenue
2. Contract balances
3. Performance obligations
4. Significant judgments
5. Costs to obtain and fulfill contracts

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Profitability Metrics
| KPI | Formula | Target |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Gross Profit Margin | Gross Profit / Revenue | 15-25% |
| Net Profit Margin | Net Income / Revenue | 3-8% |
| Return on Assets | Net Income / Total Assets | 5-15% |

### Operational Metrics
| KPI | Formula | Significance |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| Backlog | Total Contract Value - Earned Revenue | Work under contract |
| Fade Analysis | Final Margin - Original Margin | Estimating accuracy |
| Over/Under Billings | Net of Assets and Liabilities | Cash flow indicator |

### Liquidity Metrics
| KPI | Formula | Target |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Current Ratio | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | > 1.5 |
| Working Capital | Current Assets - Current Liabilities | Positive |
| Days Sales Outstanding | (A/R / Revenue) × 365 | < 45 days |
