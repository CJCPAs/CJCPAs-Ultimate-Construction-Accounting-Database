## Revenue Recognition Policy Disclosures

### Template: Comprehensive Revenue Recognition Policy

**Revenue Recognition**

The Company recognizes revenue from construction contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.

**Contract Identification**

The Company's contracts with customers generally consist of construction contracts for [commercial | industrial | residential | infrastructure | OTHER] projects. Contracts are identified when there is approval and commitment by both parties, each party's rights and payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collection of consideration is probable. The Company evaluates each contract to determine whether it represents a single contract or should be combined with other contracts.

**Performance Obligations**

The Company evaluates each contract to identify distinct performance obligations. For the majority of the Company's contracts, the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation because the Company provides a significant service of integrating the goods and services into the combined output for which the customer has contracted. In some cases, contracts may include multiple performance obligations, such as:

- Construction services
- Design services
- Preconstruction services
- Equipment procurement
- Warranty services beyond standard warranties
- Operations and maintenance services

When contracts contain multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.

**Transaction Price**

The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services. The transaction price may include:

- Fixed consideration (contract price)
- Variable consideration (incentive fees, penalties, claims, unpriced change orders)
- Consideration payable to the customer (if any)

Variable consideration is included in the transaction price when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company estimates variable consideration using the expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration.

**Revenue Recognition Over Time**

The Company's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced. Accordingly, revenue is recognized over time using the cost-to-cost method (percentage-of-completion). Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion.

The formula for revenue recognition is:

```
Revenue = (Costs Incurred to Date / Total Estimated Costs) × Total Estimated Revenue
```

**Contract Costs**

Costs included in the cost-to-cost calculation consist of:

*Direct Costs:*
- Direct materials
- Direct labor
- Subcontractor costs
- Equipment costs directly attributable to the project
- Other direct costs (permits, bonds, insurance, etc.)

*Indirect Costs Allocated to Contracts:*
- Field supervision
- Job site facilities and supplies
- Small tools and consumables

*Costs Excluded from Progress Calculation:*
- Uninstalled materials (unless specifically produced or fabricated for the project)
- General and administrative expenses
- Costs that are not reflective of the Company's progress

**Changes in Estimates**

Due to the nature of construction contracts, revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are common. The effects of changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined using the cumulative catch-up method. If estimates indicate that a contract will result in a loss, the entire estimated loss is recognized immediately.

## Contract Modifications (Change Orders)

### Template: Change Order Disclosures

**Contract Modifications**

Contract modifications, including change orders and claims, are common in the construction industry. The Company accounts for contract modifications as follows:

*Approved Change Orders*
Approved change orders are modifications that have been agreed upon by both the Company and the customer, including agreement on the scope of the modification and the related consideration. Approved change orders are typically accounted for as a modification of the existing contract and are reflected as a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue.

*Unapproved Change Orders*
Unapproved change orders are modifications for which work has been performed but the scope and/or price has not yet been agreed upon with the customer. Revenue from unapproved change orders is included in the transaction price when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company evaluates the probability of approval based on:

- Historical experience with the customer
- Nature of the circumstances requiring the change
- Documentation of costs and scope
- Legal entitlement under the contract
- Negotiations with the customer

*Claims*
Claims are amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that the Company seeks to collect from customers for delays, errors in specifications, or other causes of unanticipated additional costs. Revenue from claims is recognized when:

- It is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue
- The amount can be reliably estimated
- The claim has a legal basis

As of [DATE], the Company had $[AMOUNT] of revenue recognized from unapproved change orders and claims included in contract assets.

## Significant Judgments

### Template: Significant Judgments Disclosure

**Significant Judgments in Revenue Recognition**

The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue, particularly related to:

*Estimates of Total Contract Costs*

The Company estimates total costs at completion for each contract based on:
- Original bid or proposal estimates
- Historical cost experience on similar projects
- Current labor productivity and material prices
- Subcontractor pricing and availability
- Project schedule and complexity
- Site conditions and weather impacts
- Design completeness at project inception

These estimates are reviewed and updated monthly, with changes recognized using the cumulative catch-up method. Changes in estimates can result from various factors, including:

- Design changes and clarifications
- Differing site conditions
- Material price fluctuations
- Labor productivity variations
- Subcontractor performance
- Weather delays
- Schedule changes

*Determination of Transaction Price*

Significant judgment is required to determine the transaction price for contracts with variable consideration, including:

- Incentive or penalty provisions
- Liquidated damages exposure
- Unapproved change orders
- Contract claims
- Alternative scope options

The Company estimates variable consideration using the method (expected value or most likely amount) that better predicts the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. Variable consideration is constrained and included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

*Estimates of Expected Credit Losses*

The Company evaluates the collectibility of its contract receivables considering:
- Historical collection experience
- Customer creditworthiness
- Current economic conditions
- Industry trends

## Remaining Performance Obligations (Backlog)

### Template 1: Standard Backlog Disclosure

**Remaining Performance Obligations**

The following table summarizes the Company's remaining performance obligations (backlog) as of [DATE]:

|  | Amount |
|--|--------|
| Remaining performance obligations at [DATE] | $[AMOUNT] |

The Company expects to recognize approximately [XX]% of the remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter.

## Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts

### Template: Contract Cost Disclosures

**Costs to Obtain Contracts**

The Company incurs costs to obtain contracts, including bid and proposal costs and sales commissions. Bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred unless the costs are directly associated with a specific anticipated contract and are recoverable if the contract is obtained. Capitalizable contract acquisition costs are amortized as revenue is recognized over the contract term.

As of [DATE] and [PRIOR YEAR DATE], the Company had capitalized contract acquisition costs of $[AMOUNT] and $[AMOUNT], respectively. Amortization of contract acquisition costs was $[AMOUNT] and $[AMOUNT] for the years ended [DATE] and [PRIOR YEAR DATE], respectively.

**Costs to Fulfill Contracts**

The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred prior to the commencement of contract activities (pre-contract costs) when:
- The costs relate directly to a specific contract or anticipated contract
- The costs generate or enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations
- The costs are expected to be recovered

Pre-contract costs include mobilization costs, pre-production engineering, and setup costs that are not included in the contract price. These costs are amortized over the life of the related contract as revenue is recognized.

As of [DATE] and [PRIOR YEAR DATE], the Company had capitalized costs to fulfill contracts of $[AMOUNT] and $[AMOUNT], respectively. Amortization of these costs was $[AMOUNT] and $[AMOUNT] for the years ended [DATE] and [PRIOR YEAR DATE], respectively.

## Warranty Obligations

### Template: Warranty Disclosures

**Warranty Obligations**

Construction contracts typically include warranty provisions that require the Company to repair or replace defective work for a specified period after project completion. Standard warranties, which are typically one to two years in duration, are accounted for under ASC 460, Guarantees, and are not considered separate performance obligations. The Company accrues estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on historical experience and specific known issues.

{IF APPLICABLE: Certain contracts include extended warranties or service-type warranties that are distinct from the construction services and represent separate performance obligations. Revenue related to these warranties is deferred and recognized over the warranty period.}

Changes in warranty liabilities for the years ended [DATE] are as follows:

|  | [YEAR] | [PRIOR YEAR] |
|--|--------|--------------|
| Balance at beginning of year | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] |
| Accruals for warranties issued | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] |
| Warranty costs incurred | ([AMOUNT]) | ([AMOUNT]) |
| Adjustments to prior period accruals | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] |
| **Balance at end of year** | **$[AMOUNT]** | **$[AMOUNT]** |

## Retainage

### Template: Retainage Disclosures

**Retainage**

Retainage represents amounts billed to customers that are withheld pending satisfaction of specified conditions, typically final project completion and acceptance. Retainage is generally collected within [XX] days after final project acceptance.

Retainage receivable consists of:

|  | [DATE] | [PRIOR YEAR DATE] |
|--|--------|-------------------|
| Retainage due within one year | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] |
| Retainage due after one year | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] |
| **Total retainage receivable** | **$[AMOUNT]** | **$[AMOUNT]** |

Retainage payable to subcontractors and suppliers that the Company withholds pending completion of contract requirements totaled $[AMOUNT] and $[AMOUNT] as of [DATE] and [PRIOR YEAR DATE], respectively.

## Loss Contracts

### Template: Loss Contract Disclosures

**Provision for Contract Losses**

When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred on a contract upon completion, the entire estimated loss is recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident. Provisions for losses on contracts are included in contract liabilities on the balance sheet.

{IF APPLICABLE: During the year ended [DATE], the Company recognized provisions for estimated losses on contracts of $[AMOUNT], primarily related to [DESCRIPTION OF PROJECTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSING LOSSES]. As of [DATE], accrued contract losses totaled $[AMOUNT].}

---

## Significant Changes in Contract Estimates

### Template: Changes in Estimates Disclosure

**Changes in Contract Estimates**

Changes in estimates related to construction contracts accounted for using the cost-to-cost method are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Such changes in estimates can result in the recognition of revenue in the current period related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods.

During the years ended [DATE], the Company recognized the following amounts related to changes in estimates on contracts:

|  | [YEAR] | [PRIOR YEAR] |
|--|--------|--------------|
| Revenue recognized in current period from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] |

These amounts primarily relate to [changes in estimated costs to complete | resolution of claims and change orders | final contract settlements | OTHER].

{IF APPLICABLE: During the year ended [DATE], the Company revised its estimates on [PROJECT NAME/DESCRIPTION], which resulted in a [decrease | increase] to contract revenue of $[AMOUNT] and a [decrease | increase] to gross profit of $[AMOUNT]. The revision was due to [EXPLANATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES].}

## Significant Financing Component

### Template: Financing Component Disclosure

**Significant Financing Component**

{CHOOSE ONE:}

*Option A - No Significant Financing Component:*
The Company's contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. Payment terms are typically based on project milestones or monthly progress, and the timing difference between the transfer of services and customer payment is generally less than one year.

*Option B - Significant Financing Component Exists:*
Certain of the Company's contracts contain a significant financing component because the timing of customer payments differs significantly from the timing of the Company's performance. When contracts have a significant financing component, the Company adjusts the transaction price to reflect the time value of money.

For contracts where the customer pays in advance of the Company's performance (deferred revenue), the Company recognizes interest expense as the Company satisfies its performance obligations. For contracts where the Company's performance precedes customer payment (contract assets), the Company recognizes interest income as the Company fulfills its obligations and prior to customer payment.

During the year ended [DATE], the Company recognized interest [income | expense] of $[AMOUNT] related to significant financing components in contracts.

## Principal vs. Agent Considerations

### Template: Principal vs. Agent Disclosure

**Principal vs. Agent Considerations**

In certain transactions, the Company evaluates whether it is acting as a principal or an agent. The Company is considered a principal when it controls the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. When acting as a principal, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. When acting as an agent, revenue is recognized on a net basis (i.e., the amount of commission or fee earned).

{IF APPLICABLE: For construction management agency (CM-Advisor) arrangements, the Company acts as an agent and recognizes revenue on a net basis equal to management fees earned. Trade contractor costs on agency CM projects are not included in the Company's revenue.}

{IF APPLICABLE: For owner-furnished materials and equipment, the Company evaluates whether it controls the materials before installation. When the Company does not control owner-furnished items, they are excluded from the Company's revenue and costs.}
