{CHOOSE ONE:}

*Option A - No Impairment:*
During the years ended [DATE] and [PRIOR YEAR DATE], no impairment losses were recognized.

*Option B - Impairment Recognized:*
During the year ended [DATE], the Company recognized impairment losses of $[AMOUNT] related to [DESCRIPTION OF ASSETS AND CIRCUMSTANCES].
