## Lease Policy Disclosures

### Template 1: Comprehensive Lease Policy

**Leases**

The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. The Company has operating and finance leases for [office space | equipment yards | heavy equipment | vehicles | job site trailers | other equipment]. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (ROU) assets, operating lease liabilities - current, and operating lease liabilities - noncurrent on the balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, finance lease liabilities - current, and finance lease liabilities - noncurrent on the balance sheet.

ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.

The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments when the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate the Company would pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term.

The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made at or before commencement and excludes lease incentives received. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option.

**Practical Expedients**

The Company has elected the following practical expedients:
- **Short-term lease exemption**: Leases with terms of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
- **Non-separation of lease and non-lease components**: For all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease components from non-lease components (such as maintenance services).

**Variable Lease Payments**

Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate are included in the measurement of lease liabilities using the index or rate at the commencement date. Variable payments not dependent on an index or rate, such as payments based on usage or performance, are recognized as expense in the period incurred.

### Template 2: Equipment-Focused Policy

**Equipment Leases**

The Company leases construction equipment, vehicles, and other assets to supplement its owned fleet and meet project-specific requirements. Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases based on criteria specified in ASC 842.

The Company often enters into short-term equipment rentals for specific projects. These arrangements, typically month-to-month or for terms of less than 12 months, are not recorded on the balance sheet under the short-term lease practical expedient. Short-term rental expense is recognized as incurred and charged to the applicable projects.
