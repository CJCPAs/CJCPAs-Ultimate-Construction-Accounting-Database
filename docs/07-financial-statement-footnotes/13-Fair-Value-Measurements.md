# Fair Value Measurements Disclosures

## Overview

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. While construction companies may have fewer complex fair value measurements than financial institutions, there are still important disclosures related to certain assets, liabilities, and financial instruments.

## Fair Value Hierarchy

### Template: Fair Value Hierarchy Explanation

**Fair Value Measurements**

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Level 1** | Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities |
| **Level 2** | Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data |
| **Level 3** | Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities |

The Company's policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period.

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments

### Template 1: Financial Instruments Disclosure

**Fair Value of Financial Instruments**

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments:

| | [DATE] | [PRIOR YEAR DATE] |
|--|--------|-------------------|
| | Carrying Value | Fair Value | Carrying Value | Fair Value |
| **Financial Assets:** |  |  |  |  |
| Cash and cash equivalents | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] |
| Accounts receivable | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] |
| Notes receivable | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] |

| Line of credit | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] |
| Notes payable | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] |

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value:

*Cash and Cash Equivalents*
Carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments (Level 1).

*Accounts Receivable and Payable*
Carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments (Level 2).

*Notes Receivable and Payable*
Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar terms and credit quality (Level 2).

*Line of Credit*
Carrying value approximates fair value as the interest rate resets to market rates periodically (Level 2).

### Template 2: Debt Fair Value

**Fair Value of Debt**

The estimated fair values of the Company's debt instruments are as follows:

| | [DATE] | [PRIOR YEAR DATE] |
|--|--------|-------------------|
| | Carrying Value | Fair Value | Carrying Value | Fair Value |
| Variable rate debt | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] | $[AMOUNT] |
| Fixed rate debt | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] | [AMOUNT] |

The fair value of variable rate debt approximates carrying value as interest rates reset periodically to current market rates.

The fair value of fixed rate debt is estimated using discounted cash flows based on current market rates for similar debt instruments. The fair value measurements are based on Level 2 inputs.

## Valuation Techniques

### Template: Valuation Methodology Disclosure

**Valuation Techniques**

The Company uses the following valuation techniques for assets and liabilities measured at fair value:

|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Money market funds | Quoted prices | NAV (Level 1) |
| Certificates of deposit | Market approach | Bank quoted rates (Level 2) |
| Interest rate swaps | Income approach | SOFR curves, credit spreads (Level 2) |
| Property - impairment | Market approach | Comparable sales, appraised values (Level 3) |
| Equipment - impairment | Market/Cost approach | Auction data, replacement cost (Level 2/3) |
| Goodwill - impairment | Income approach | Discounted cash flows (Level 3) |

## Level 3 Unobservable Inputs

### Template: Level 3 Input Sensitivity

**Level 3 Inputs and Sensitivity**

The following table presents quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements:

| Asset/Liability | Fair Value | Valuation Technique | Unobservable Input | Range |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Investment in joint venture | $[AMOUNT] | Discounted cash flow | Discount rate | [X]% - [X]% |
|  |  |  | Terminal growth rate | [X]% - [X]% |
| Real property | $[AMOUNT] | Sales comparison | Adjustment factor | [X]% - [X]% |
| Contingent consideration | $[AMOUNT] | Probability weighted | Probability of payment | [X]% - [X]% |

*Sensitivity Analysis*
Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in the probability of payment would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement for contingent consideration.

## Items Not Measured at Fair Value

### Template: Non-Fair Value Items

**Items Not Measured at Fair Value**

The following items are not measured at fair value in the Company's balance sheet:

*Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities*
Contract assets (costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings) and contract liabilities (billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings) are not financial instruments and are not measured at fair value. These balances reflect the status of contract accounting and are settled through the normal course of contract performance.

*Goodwill*
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist but is not carried at fair value unless impaired.

*Long-Lived Assets*
Property, plant, and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and are only measured at fair value when impaired.

## Derivative Instruments

### Template: Interest Rate Swap Disclosure

**Derivative Instruments**

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
