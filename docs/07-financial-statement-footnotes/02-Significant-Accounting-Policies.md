---

### Use of Estimates

---

**Template: Standard**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the estimated costs to complete construction contracts, the recoverability of contract assets, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the useful lives of property and equipment, and contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

---

**Template: Expanded for Construction**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of these financial statements include:

- **Contract revenue and cost estimates** - The Company recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires estimates of total contract costs. Changes in estimates can significantly affect recognized revenue and gross profit.
- **Contract claims and unapproved change orders** - Revenue from claims and unapproved change orders is recognized when recovery is probable and amounts can be reliably estimated.
- **Accounts receivable collectibility** - The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical experience and management's assessment of current conditions.
- **Useful lives of property and equipment** - Depreciation is based on estimated useful lives that may differ from actual service lives.
- **Self-insurance reserves** - The Company estimates liabilities for self-insured workers' compensation and general liability claims based on actuarial analyses and historical experience.
- **Legal contingencies** - The Company estimates liabilities for pending legal matters based on the probability of loss and ability to estimate the amount.
- **Income taxes** - Tax positions are evaluated for recognition and measurement based on the more-likely-than-not threshold.

Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

---

### Revenue Recognition

---

**Template: Percentage-of-Completion (Cost-to-Cost Method)**

The Company recognizes revenue from construction contracts over time as the Company satisfies performance obligations by transferring control of promised goods or services to customers. The Company's construction contracts typically represent a single performance obligation to deliver a completed project.

Revenue is recognized over time using the cost-to-cost method, which measures progress toward completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion. This method is used because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as the Company performs under the contract.

Contract costs include all direct material, labor, subcontractor costs, and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as supplies, tools, repairs, and depreciation. General and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Changes in estimates of total contract revenue or costs are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined, without regard to the percentage of completion.

---

**Template: Completed Contract Method (If Still Applicable)**

The Company recognizes revenue from certain short-term construction contracts upon completion of the contract. This method is used for contracts that are expected to be completed within a [XX]-month period and where reliable estimates of progress toward completion cannot be made. Under this method, contract costs are accumulated during the construction period, and no revenue or income is recognized until the contract is substantially complete.

---

**Template: Time and Materials Contracts**

For time-and-materials contracts, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value transferred to the customer based on the Company's performance to date. Revenue is typically recognized as labor hours are incurred and materials are delivered.

---

**Template: Unit Price Contracts**

For unit-price contracts, the Company recognizes revenue based on the number of units delivered or installed multiplied by the contractually agreed-upon price per unit. Revenue is recognized as units are completed and accepted by the customer.

---

**Template: Multiple Performance Obligations**

Certain contracts contain multiple performance obligations, such as design services and construction services. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price is the price at which the Company would sell the promised good or service separately to a customer. Revenue for each performance obligation is then recognized over time or at a point in time as appropriate for that obligation.

---

### Contract Modifications

---

**Template: Change Orders and Modifications**

Contract modifications, including change orders and claims, are included in total estimated contract revenue when the modification is approved by the customer or when realization is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated. Modifications that create new enforceable rights and obligations are accounted for as separate contracts. Modifications to existing contracts are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract as a cumulative catch-up adjustment.

Unapproved change orders and claims are included in contract revenue when recovery is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Company evaluates the probability of recovery based on past experience with the customer, the nature of the work performed, and the specific terms of the contract.

---

### Contract Assets and Liabilities

---

**Template: Standard**

Contract assets arise when the Company performs work in advance of billing and represent the Company's right to consideration for work completed but not yet billed. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when billing occurs and the right to consideration becomes unconditional.

Contract liabilities arise when the Company receives advance payments from customers before work is performed and represent the Company's obligation to transfer goods or services to the customer. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as the Company satisfies its performance obligations.

---

### Accounts Receivable

---

**Template: Standard**

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest unless payment is past due. The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic conditions. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established for specific accounts receivable where collection is doubtful. Receivables are written off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.

---

**Template: With Retainage**

Accounts receivable include billed and unbilled amounts arising from construction contracts. Retainage receivable represents amounts billed but not yet paid pending completion of the contract and satisfaction of contractual conditions. Retainage is typically collected within [XX] days after project completion and acceptance.

The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic conditions. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established for specific accounts receivable where collection is doubtful. Receivables are written off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.

---

### Cash and Cash Equivalents

---

**Template: Standard**

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

---

**Template: With Restricted Cash**

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Restricted cash consists of amounts held in escrow for [retainage obligations | contract performance guarantees | insurance reserves | union benefit payments | OTHER]. Restricted cash is classified as current or noncurrent based on the expected timing of the related disbursement.

---

### Investments

---

**Template: Marketable Securities**

Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of [stockholders' | members' | partners'] equity. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense).

---

### Property, Plant, and Equipment

---

**Template: Standard**

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the [straight-line | declining balance | units of production] method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

| Asset Category | Useful Life |
|---------------|-------------|
| Buildings and improvements | [XX] - [XX] years |
| Heavy equipment | [XX] - [XX] years |
| Vehicles | [XX] - [XX] years |
| Office furniture and equipment | [XX] - [XX] years |
| Computer equipment and software | [XX] - [XX] years |
| Small tools and equipment | [XX] - [XX] years |

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining lease term.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income.

---

**Template: With Impairment Policy**

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the [straight-line | declining balance | units of production] method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.

---

### Leases

---

**Template: ASC 842 Lessee**

The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.

ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made at or before commencement and excludes lease incentives received.

The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets. Additionally, the Company has elected the short-term lease exception, under which leases with terms of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.

Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period incurred.

---

### Fair Value Measurements

---

**Template: Standard**

The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value:

- **Level 1** - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- **Level 2** - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in inactive markets, or model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable
- **Level 3** - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions

The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

---

### Income Taxes

---

**Template: C Corporation**

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, the Company considers future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and recent operating results.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.

---

**Template: S Corporation / Pass-Through Entity**

The Company has elected to be taxed as an S corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state statutes. Under these provisions, the Company does not pay federal corporate income taxes on its taxable income. Instead, the [shareholders | members | partners] are liable for individual federal and state income taxes on their proportionate share of the Company's taxable income. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes is included in the accompanying financial statements.

{IF APPLICABLE: The Company is subject to certain state income and franchise taxes, which are included in income tax expense.}

The Company evaluates its tax positions and recognizes only those positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. As of [DATE], the Company has no uncertain tax positions.

---

**Template: LLC**

The Company is a limited liability company and has elected to be treated as a [partnership | disregarded entity | S corporation] for federal income tax purposes. The Company's taxable income or loss is allocated to its members in accordance with the operating agreement. Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes is included in the accompanying financial statements.

{IF APPLICABLE: The Company is subject to certain state income and franchise taxes, which are included in income tax expense.}

---

### Advertising Costs

---

**Template: Standard**

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $[AMOUNT] and $[AMOUNT] for the years ended [DATE] and [DATE], respectively.

---

### Concentration of Credit Risk

---

**Template: Standard**

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash deposits and accounts receivable.

The Company maintains its cash balances in financial institutions, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash balances.

The Company grants credit to its customers, substantially all of whom are [general contractors | building owners | developers | government agencies] located in [GEOGRAPHIC AREA]. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis and generally does not require collateral. {OPTIONAL: At [DATE], [XX]% of accounts receivable was due from [XX] customers.}

---

### Goodwill and Intangible Assets

---

**Template: Goodwill**

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company performs its annual impairment test as of [DATE].

The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment indicates that impairment is more likely than not, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative impairment test is performed.

---

**Template: Intangible Assets**

Intangible assets consist of [customer relationships | non-compete agreements | trade names | contract backlog | OTHER] acquired in business combinations and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:

| Intangible Asset | Useful Life |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Customer relationships | [XX] years |
| Non-compete agreements | [XX] years |
| Trade names | [XX] years |
| Contract backlog | [XX] years |

The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

---

### Business Combinations

---

**Template: Standard**

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. Under this method, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

---
