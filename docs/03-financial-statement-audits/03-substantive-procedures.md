# Substantive Audit Procedures for Construction Companies

## Overview

Substantive procedures provide direct audit evidence about financial statement assertions. For construction companies, these procedures focus on significant estimates, contract accounting, and unique balance sheet presentations.

## Assertions and Objectives

### Primary Assertions by Account

| Account | Key Assertions | Focus |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Contract Revenue | Accuracy, Cutoff, Occurrence | POC calculation, period |
| Contract Assets (Underbillings) | Existence, Valuation | Recoverability |
| Contract Liabilities (Overbillings) | Completeness, Valuation | Proper deferral |
| Accounts Receivable | Existence, Valuation | Collectibility |
| Retainage Receivable | Existence, Valuation | Terms, collectibility |
| Work in Process Costs | Existence, Accuracy | Proper coding |
| Property & Equipment | Existence, Valuation | Depreciation |
| Accounts Payable | Completeness | Unrecorded liabilities |

## Cash and Banking

### Standard Procedures

| Procedure | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Bank confirmations | Existence, completeness |
| Bank reconciliations | Accuracy |
| Cutoff testing | Proper period |
| Restricted cash review | Presentation |

### Construction-Specific Considerations

- **Multiple accounts:** Operating, payroll, retainage
- **Joint venture accounts:** Separate banking arrangements
- **Escrow accounts:** Owner deposits, retainage

## Accounts Receivable

### Confirmation Procedures

**Selection Criteria:**
| Category | Selection Method |
|----------|------------------|
| Large balances | 100% over threshold |
| Retainage | High risk - confirm |
| Past due | Risk of collectibility |
| Related party | Confirm all |

```

### Alternative Procedures

If confirmation not received:
1. Subsequent cash receipts testing
2. Review billing documentation
3. Examine contract and correspondence
4. Verify owner payment history

### Collectibility Assessment

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| Aging | Review past due amounts |
| Payment history | Pattern of payments |
| Owner financial condition | Public info, credit reports |
| Disputed amounts | Outstanding issues |
| Economic conditions | Industry trends |

## Revenue Testing

### WIP Schedule Analysis

**Analytical Procedures:**
```
WIP SCHEDULE ANALYTICAL REVIEW

1. Overall Reasonableness
   - Compare to prior year
   - Calculate expected revenue based on backlog
   - Compare gross profit margins

2. Individual Contract Analysis
   - Significant contracts reviewed in detail
   - Contracts with declining margins
   - Contracts near completion
   - Contracts with significant overbillings

3. Trend Analysis
   - Month-to-month billings trends
   - Gross profit trend by contract
   - Over/underbillings trend
```

**Selection Criteria for Testing:**
| Criterion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Largest contracts | Significant to financial statements |
| Highest GP% | Risk of overstatement |
| Lowest/negative GP% | Loss recognition |
| Significant estimate changes | Estimation risk |
| Near completion | Cutoff risk |
| Significant underbillings | Collectibility risk |
