### Sample Unmodified Opinion

```
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
XYZ Construction Company

Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of XYZ Construction Company, 
which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, and the 
related statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and 
cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the 
financial statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, 
in all material respects, the financial position of XYZ Construction 
Company as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations 
and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in 
the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent 
of XYZ Construction Company and to meet our other ethical 
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical 
requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion.

Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation 
of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the 
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant 
to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to 
evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the 
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about XYZ Construction 
Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year 
after the date the financial statements are issued.

Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and 
therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered 
material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or 
in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a 
reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:

• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
  throughout the audit.
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design 
  and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
  on the effectiveness of XYZ Construction Company's internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
  reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, 
  as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial 
  statements.
• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, 
  considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about 
  XYZ Construction Company's ability to continue as a going concern 
  for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control–
related matters that we identified during the audit.

## Modified Opinions

### Types of Modifications

| Type | When Used |
|------|-----------|
| Qualified | Material but not pervasive misstatement or scope limitation |
| Adverse | Material and pervasive misstatement |
| Disclaimer | Material and pervasive scope limitation |

### Construction-Specific Qualification Scenarios

#### Revenue Recognition Departure

```
Qualified Opinion

In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in 
the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our report, the 
accompanying financial statements present fairly...

Basis for Qualified Opinion

As described in Note X, the Company recognizes revenue on certain 
fixed-price construction contracts using the completed contract 
method. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America require revenue to be recognized over time for 
contracts meeting the criteria of ASC 606. Had the Company applied 
the percentage-of-completion method, contract revenue would have 
increased by $X, costs would have increased by $X, and net income 
would have increased by $X for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Additionally, total assets would have increased by $X and 
stockholders' equity would have increased by $X.
```

#### Scope Limitation - Estimates

```
Qualified Opinion

In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter 
described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our 
report, the accompanying financial statements present fairly...

Basis for Qualified Opinion

The Company's records do not permit us to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence regarding the estimated costs to 
complete certain construction contracts totaling $X in contract 
revenue. Consequently, we were unable to determine whether any 
adjustments to revenue and related accounts might be necessary.
```

## Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraphs

### When Required or Appropriate

| Situation | Required/Optional |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Going concern | Required if substantial doubt |
| Change in accounting principle | Required |
| Significant estimates uncertainty | Optional |
| Significant related party transactions | Optional |
| Subsequent events | Optional |

### Going Concern Example

```
Emphasis of Matter — Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming 
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in 
Note X to the financial statements, the Company has experienced 
recurring losses from operations and has a working capital deficiency. 
Additionally, the Company's bonding capacity has been reduced by its 
surety. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's 
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding 
these matters are also described in Note X. The financial statements 
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome 
of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to 
this matter.
```

### Significant Estimate Example

```
Emphasis of Matter — Significant Estimates

As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company 
has significant pending claims against project owners totaling 
approximately $X. The ultimate resolution of these claims is 
uncertain, and the actual amounts realized could differ materially 
from the amounts recorded. Our opinion is not modified with 
respect to this matter.
```

## Other-Matter Paragraphs

### Supplementary Information

```
Other Matter

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole. The accompanying schedule 
of work in progress is presented for purposes of additional 
analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements. 
Such information is the responsibility of management and was 
derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting 
and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The 
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied 
in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional 
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information 
directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to 
prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements 
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with 
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all 
material respects in relation to the financial statements as 
a whole.
```

## Special Purpose Financial Statements

### Cash Basis Reporting

Some small construction companies report on cash basis:

```
Independent Auditor's Report

Opinion

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and 
equity arising from cash transactions of XYZ Construction Company 
as of December 31, 2024, and its revenue collected and expenses 
paid for the year then ended in accordance with the cash basis 
of accounting described in Note X.

Basis for Opinion

[Standard basis for opinion language]

Emphasis of Matter — Basis of Accounting

We draw attention to Note X of the financial statements, which 
describes the basis of accounting. The financial statements are 
prepared on the cash basis of accounting, which is a basis of 
accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified 
with respect to this matter.
```

### Tax Basis Reporting

```
Opinion

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 
XYZ Construction Company as of December 31, 2024, and the 
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then 
ended in accordance with the basis of accounting the Company 
uses for federal income tax purposes.

Emphasis of Matter — Basis of Accounting

We draw attention to Note X of the financial statements, which 
describes the basis of accounting. The financial statements are 
prepared on the basis of accounting the Company uses for federal 
income tax purposes, which is a basis of accounting other than 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this 
matter.
```

## Report Dating Considerations

### Date of Report

The audit report should be dated no earlier than when:
1. Sufficient appropriate evidence obtained
2. Financial statements prepared and approved by management
3. Management takes responsibility for the financial statements

### Dual Dating

If subsequent event requires disclosure but occurred after fieldwork:

```
[Date], except for Note X, as to which the date is [later date]
```

## Bonding Company Requirements

### Special Considerations

Surety companies often require:
- Unmodified (clean) opinion
- Specific financial statement presentation
- WIP schedule as supplementary information
- Particular disclosure requirements

### Impact on Opinion

If bonding company requirements conflict with GAAP:
- Follow GAAP requirements
- Consider emphasis paragraph
- Discuss with bonding company
