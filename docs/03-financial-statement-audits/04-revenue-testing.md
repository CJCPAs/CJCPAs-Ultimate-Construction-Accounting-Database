# Revenue Testing in Construction Audits

## Overview

Revenue testing is the most critical area in construction audits. This chapter provides detailed guidance on testing revenue recognition under ASC 606 for construction contracts.

## Revenue Recognition Framework

### ASC 606 Application to Construction

**Recognition Over Time Criteria:**
Most construction contracts meet criteria for over-time recognition:

| Criterion | Construction Application |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Customer receives benefit as performed | Less common for construction |
| Creates asset with no alternative use | Building on customer's land |
| Right to payment for performance to date | Enforceable billing rights |

### Methods of Measuring Progress

| Method | Description | When Appropriate |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Cost-to-Cost | Costs incurred / Total estimated | Most construction contracts |
| Labor Hours | Hours worked / Total estimated | Labor-intensive work |
| Units Delivered | Units complete / Total units | Repetitive work |
| Survey | Physical inspection | Complex projects |

## Detailed Revenue Testing Procedures

### Step 1: Obtain and Review WIP Schedule

```
WIP SCHEDULE REVIEW CHECKLIST

Initial Review:
□ Foot and crossfoot WIP schedule
□ Agree opening balances to prior year
□ Agree individual contracts to contract documents
□ Verify mathematical accuracy of calculations

Reasonableness Checks:
□ Gross profit margins within expected range
□ No contracts with unrealistic margins
□ Over/underbillings reasonable
□ Backlog consistent with operations
```

### Step 2: Select Contracts for Testing

**Risk-Based Selection:**

| Risk Factor | Selection Priority |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Largest contracts | High - significant to FS |
| Highest profit margins | High - estimation risk |
| Lowest/negative margins | High - loss recognition |
| Significant estimate changes | High - management judgment |
| Near completion | High - cutoff risk |
| Significant underbillings | High - collectibility |
| New customers | Medium - experience |
| Fixed-price contracts | Medium - cost risk |

**Sample Selection Matrix:**
```
CONTRACT SELECTION

Selection Criteria:
1. All contracts > $1,000,000 (9 contracts)
2. Contracts with GP% > 20% (3 additional)
3. Contracts with estimate revisions > 10% (2 additional)
4. Random sample of remaining (5 contracts)
Total Selected: 19 contracts

Coverage:
Total WIP Revenue: $18,266,875
Selected Revenue: $15,425,000
Coverage: 84.4%
```

### Step 3: Test Contract Terms

```
CONTRACT TERMS VERIFICATION

Contract: 2024-001 ABC Office Building

1. Contract Documents
   □ Signed contract obtained
   □ Contract amount per contract: $5,200,000
   □ Contract amount per WIP: $5,350,000
   □ Difference due to change orders: $150,000 ✓

2. Key Terms Noted:
   - Contract type: Fixed-price
   - Payment terms: Progress billing monthly
   - Retainage: 10% until substantial completion
   - Warranty: 1 year
   - Liquidated damages: $2,000/day after 3/1/25

3. Change Orders
   - CO#1: Additional HVAC ($85,000) - Approved
   - CO#2: Structural revision ($65,000) - Approved
   - Pending changes: None

4. Revenue Recognition Basis
   - Over time recognition appropriate (customer owns land)
   - Cost-to-cost method used (per Company policy)
```

### Step 4: Test Costs to Date

**Job Cost Testing:**
```
COSTS TO DATE TESTING

Contract: 2024-001
Costs to Date per WIP: $4,125,000

Testing Approach:
1. Obtain job cost detail
2. Select sample of costs
3. Vouch to supporting documents
4. Verify job coding

Sample Selection:
- All items > $50,000 (15 items)
- Random sample of remainder (25 items)
- Total selected: 40 items
- Dollar coverage: $2,850,000 (69%)

Results:
Item          Type        Amount    Reference    Proper?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ABC Steel     Sub         $425,000  Inv 1234     Yes
XYZ Concrete  Sub         $185,000  Inv 5678     Yes
Payroll 12/15 Labor       $62,000   PR Register  Yes
CAT Rental    Equipment   $48,000   Inv 9012     Yes
[Additional items...]

Exceptions: None

Conclusion: Costs to date properly supported and coded
```

### Step 5: Evaluate Estimates to Complete

**Estimate Analysis:**
```
ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE EVALUATION

Contract: 2024-001
Estimated Cost to Complete: $475,000

Components of Estimate:
Category             Estimate    Budget     % of Budget
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Remaining Labor      $125,000   $150,000   83%
Remaining Materials  $150,000   $175,000   86%
Remaining Subs       $175,000   $200,000   88%
Other Direct          $25,000    $25,000   100%
Total               $475,000   $550,000    86%

Analysis:
- Estimates appear conservative vs. budget
- Project 90% complete, limited remaining work
- No significant risks identified by PM
- Consistent with physical progress
- No unusual estimate changes from prior period

Subsequent Events Review:
- Reviewed costs incurred through 1/31/25
- $85,000 additional costs (reasonable pace)
- No significant overruns or issues identified

Conclusion: Estimate to complete appears reasonable
```

### Step 6: Recalculate Revenue

```
REVENUE RECALCULATION

Contract: 2024-001

Per Client:
Costs to Date:              $4,125,000
Total Estimated Costs:      $4,600,000
Percent Complete:           89.67%
Contract Price:             $5,350,000
Earned Revenue:             $4,796,875

Per Audit:
Costs to Date:              $4,125,000 ✓
Total Estimated Costs:      $4,600,000 ✓
Percent Complete:           $4,125,000 / $4,600,000 = 89.67% ✓
Contract Price:             $5,350,000 ✓
Earned Revenue:             89.67% × $5,350,000 = $4,796,875 ✓

Difference: $0

Conclusion: Revenue calculation correct
```

### Step 7: Test Billings

```
BILLINGS TESTING

Contract: 2024-001
Billings to Date per WIP: $4,650,000

Test Procedure:
1. Obtain billing detail
2. Select sample of billings
3. Trace to pay applications
4. Verify owner approval

Results:
App#    Period     Gross Bill   Retainage   Net Bill    Approved
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Total Billed:                  $4,650,000 ✓
Total Retainage:                 $465,000
Total Net Billing:             $4,185,000

Conclusion: Billings properly supported
```

### Step 8: Calculate Over/Underbilling

```
OVER/UNDERBILLING CALCULATION

Contract: 2024-001

Earned Revenue:           $4,796,875
Less: Billings to Date:  ($4,650,000)

- Owner reviewing - response expected in 30 days

Variable Consideration Assessment:
Factor                              Assessment
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Legal entitlement                   Strong
Evidence of conditions              Documented
Owner acknowledgment                Partial
Historical resolution pattern       75% approval
Constraint factors                  Moderate uncertainty

Conclusion:

- Disclose in notes as contingent asset
- Reassess in future periods
```

## Testing Loss Contracts

### Identification

```
LOSS CONTRACT IDENTIFICATION

Review of WIP Schedule for Loss Indicators:

Contract     Contract    Est Cost    Est Profit    GP%
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2024-001     $5,350,000  $4,600,000    $750,000   14.0%
2024-002     $3,200,000  $2,750,000    $450,000   14.1%
2024-003     $8,500,000  $7,400,000  $1,100,000   12.9%
2024-004     $2,100,000  $1,850,000    $250,000   11.9%
2024-005    $12,000,000 $10,200,000  $1,800,000   15.0%
2024-006     $1,800,000  $1,900,000   ($100,000)  -5.6% **

** Loss contract identified - requires testing
```

### Loss Contract Testing

```
LOSS CONTRACT TESTING

Contract: 2024-006 Retail Store Renovation

Contract Price:              $1,800,000
Costs to Date:              $1,520,000
Estimated Cost to Complete:    $380,000
Total Estimated Costs:       $1,900,000
Estimated Loss:              ($100,000)

Loss Recognition Test:
- Per ASC 606, recognize loss immediately
- Loss = Total estimated costs - contract price
- Loss = $1,900,000 - $1,800,000 = $100,000

Revenue Recognition:
- % Complete = $1,520,000 / $1,900,000 = 80%
- Revenue = $1,520,000 (limited to costs on loss contract)
- Current period loss accrual = $100,000 (remaining loss)

Verify Loss Estimate:
1. Reviewed estimate with PM
2. Analyzed cost overruns:
   - Labor inefficiency: $50,000
   - Material price increases: $35,000
   - Additional scope: $15,000
3. Confirmed no additional claims/changes expected
4. Estimate appears appropriate

Conclusion: Loss properly recognized
```

## Revenue Cutoff Testing

### Procedures

```
REVENUE CUTOFF TESTING
