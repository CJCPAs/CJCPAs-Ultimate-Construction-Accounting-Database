# WIP Audit Procedures

## Overview

The Work-in-Progress (WIP) schedule is the cornerstone document for construction company audits. This chapter details comprehensive procedures for auditing the WIP schedule.

## WIP Schedule Audit Approach

### Overall Objectives

| Objective | Assertion | Focus |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Existence | Contract exists and is active | Contract documentation |
| Completeness | All contracts included | Backlog reconciliation |
| Accuracy | Calculations correct | Mathematical testing |
| Valuation | Estimates reasonable | Management judgment |
| Rights | Company has contract rights | Contract terms |
| Presentation | Properly classified | Over/underbillings |

### Initial Procedures

```
WIP SCHEDULE INITIAL PROCEDURES

1. Obtain and Review
   □ Complete WIP schedule as of year-end
   □ Prior year WIP schedule
   □ Interim WIP schedules
   □ Supporting job cost reports

2. Analytical Review
   □ Compare to prior year
   □ Calculate key metrics
   □ Identify unusual items
   □ Note significant changes

3. Mathematical Testing
   □ Foot all columns
   □ Crossfoot all rows
   □ Verify formula accuracy
   □ Trace to general ledger
```

## Over/Underbilling Analysis

### Classification and Presentation

```
OVER/UNDERBILLING CLASSIFICATION

Per WIP Schedule:
                              Amount       Contracts
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Underbillings (Assets):      $746,875         15
Overbillings (Liabilities):  $370,000          8
Net Underbillings:           $376,875

Proper Classification Test:
- Each contract evaluated individually
- Assets and liabilities not netted across contracts
- Significant contracts presented separately (if required)

Balance Sheet Presentation:
Current Assets:
  Costs in Excess of Billings:      $746,875

Current Liabilities:
  Billings in Excess of Costs:      $370,000

Conclusion: Over/underbillings properly classified
```

### Underbilling Collectibility

```
UNDERBILLING COLLECTIBILITY ASSESSMENT

Significant Underbillings Review:

Contract     Underbilling   Customer          Assessment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2024-003     $200,000       State DOT         Government - collectible
2024-005     $400,000       Med Group LLC     Private - strong history
2024-001     $146,875       ABC Development   Private - current payer

Overall Assessment:
- No impairment indicators identified
- All customers have strong payment history
- No disputes or collection issues outstanding
- Underbillings expected to be realized through final billing

Conclusion: Underbillings are collectible
```

### Overbilling Analysis

```
OVERBILLING ANALYSIS

Significant Overbillings:

Contract     Overbilling    Reason              Concern?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2024-002     $160,000       Front-loaded SOV    Review GP at completion
2024-004     $210,000       Mobilization heavy  Review final profit

Assessment:
- Overbillings represent deferred revenue
- Review gross profit recognized vs. overall estimate
- Evaluate for potential profit "borrowing"

Calculation of Overbilled Profit:
Contract 2024-002:
  Earned Revenue:        $2,240,000
  Billings:             $2,400,000
  Overbilling:           $160,000
  
  Earned GP:             $315,000 (14.1%)
  Billings imply:        GP on billings would be higher
  
  Remaining GP:          $450,000 - $315,000 = $135,000
  Remaining Billings:    $3,200,000 - $2,400,000 = $800,000
  Remaining GP%:         16.9%
  
  Conclusion: Final profit expected to be consistent

Conclusion: Overbillings do not indicate profit manipulation
