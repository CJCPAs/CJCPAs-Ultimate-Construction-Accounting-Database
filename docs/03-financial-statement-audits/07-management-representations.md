# Management Representations for Construction Audits

## Overview

Management representations are written statements from management confirming certain matters or supporting audit evidence. For construction companies, specific representations address unique industry issues.

## Required Representations

### General Representations

All audits require standard representations regarding:
- Responsibility for financial statements
- Fair presentation in accordance with GAAP
- Completeness of information provided
- Access to all records and personnel
- Fraud and noncompliance matters
- Subsequent events

### Construction-Specific Representations

#### Contract Revenue and WIP

```
SAMPLE MANAGEMENT REPRESENTATION LANGUAGE

Revenue Recognition:
"We confirm that revenue from construction contracts is recognized 
over time using the cost-to-cost method, which management believes 
best depicts the transfer of control to customers in accordance 
with ASC 606."

Contract Completeness:
"All construction contracts entered into by the Company have been 
included in the work-in-progress schedule provided to you."

Estimates:
"The estimated costs to complete construction contracts represent 
our best estimates based on current information available and our 
experience with similar projects."

Loss Contracts:
"We have identified all contracts where total estimated costs exceed 
the contract price, and appropriate losses have been recognized in 
the financial statements."
```

#### Change Orders and Claims

```
Change Orders:
"All approved change orders have been included in contract prices on 
the work-in-progress schedule. Unapproved change orders have been 
evaluated for inclusion as variable consideration and are included 
only when collection is highly probable."

Claims:
"We have disclosed all claims against owners and have recorded revenue 
for claims only when we have a legal basis for the claim, the amount 
can be reliably estimated, and collection is probable."

Pending Litigation:
"We have disclosed all pending or threatened litigation related to 
construction contracts, and the financial statements include appropriate 
provisions for probable losses."
```

#### Assets and Liabilities

```
Contract Assets:
"Contract assets (costs in excess of billings) represent work performed 
for which billing has not yet occurred. These amounts are expected to be 
collected and no impairment is required."

Contract Liabilities:
"Contract liabilities (billings in excess of costs) represent advance 
payments from customers and will be recognized as revenue as performance 
obligations are satisfied."

Retainage:
"Retainage receivables represent amounts contractually withheld by 
customers that will be collected upon contract completion. No allowance 
for uncollectible retainage is necessary."
```

#### Related Parties and Commitments

```
Related Parties:
"We have disclosed all related party transactions, including any 
transactions with affiliated construction entities, joint ventures, 
or entities owned by shareholders/members."

Commitments:
"We have disclosed all material commitments, including equipment 
purchase commitments, lease obligations, and bonding commitments."

Guarantees:
"We have disclosed all guarantees, including personal guarantees 
provided to bonding companies or lenders."
```
