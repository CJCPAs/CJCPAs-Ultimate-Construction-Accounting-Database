# Financial Statement Audit Planning for Construction Companies

## Overview

Audit planning for construction companies requires understanding the unique risks and complexities of the industry. This guide covers planning procedures specific to construction company audits.

## Understanding the Entity

### Industry Knowledge Requirements

| Area | Key Considerations |
|------|-------------------|
| Contract Types | Fixed-price, cost-plus, T&M, unit price |
| Revenue Recognition | ASC 606, percentage of completion |
| Bonding | Capacity, requirements, limitations |
| Geographic Operations | Multi-state, jurisdictional risks |
| Specialization | General, heavy civil, specialty trades |
| Customer Base | Public vs. private, concentration |
| Subcontractor Reliance | Percentage subcontracted |

### Business Model Understanding

```
ENTITY UNDERSTANDING CHECKLIST

□ Obtain and review organization chart
□ Identify key personnel and responsibilities
□ Understand contract acquisition process
□ Document estimating procedures
□ Understand project management structure
□ Identify significant customers and contracts
□ Review bonding company relationships
□ Understand equipment ownership vs. rental strategy
□ Document geographic footprint
□ Identify joint venture participation
```

## Risk Assessment

### Inherent Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | High Risk Indicators |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Revenue Recognition | Large pending changes, significant claims |
| Estimates | History of estimate revisions, large projects |
| Complexity | Multiple JVs, many open contracts |
| Going Concern | Underbillings trend, bonding issues |
| Related Parties | Owner-affiliated entities, intercompany |
| Fraud Risk | Pressure to meet covenants, management override |

### Construction-Specific Fraud Risks

1. **Bid Rigging:** Collusion with competitors
2. **Overbilling:** Billing for work not performed
3. **Cost Shifting:** Moving costs between jobs
4. **Fictitious Subcontractors:** Payments to non-existent entities
5. **Equipment Theft:** Inventory and equipment misappropriation
6. **Payroll Fraud:** Ghost employees, time padding
7. **Estimate Manipulation:** Overstating profit margins

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Account/Assertion | Inherent Risk | Control Risk | Risk of Material Misstatement |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Contract Revenue | High | Varies | High |
| Costs in Excess of Billings | High | Varies | High |
| Billings in Excess of Costs | High | Varies | High |
| Accounts Receivable | Moderate | Varies | Moderate |
| Work in Process Costs | High | Varies | High |
| Equipment (Valuation) | Moderate | Varies | Moderate |
| Subcontractor Payables | Moderate | Varies | Moderate |

## Materiality

### Materiality Considerations

**Common Bases:**
| Base | Typical Range | When to Use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Total Revenue | 0.5% - 2% | Established contractors |
| Gross Profit | 2% - 5% | When GP is key metric |
| Total Assets | 0.5% - 2% | Asset-intensive operations |
| Net Income | 3% - 5% | Profitable operations |
| Equity | 2% - 5% | When equity covenant exists |

**Construction-Specific Factors:**
- Bonding company financial statement requirements
- Lender covenant requirements
- Surety aggregate limits
- Owner prequalification thresholds

### Materiality Calculation Example

```
MATERIALITY CALCULATION

Selected Base: Total Revenue
Amount: $25,000,000
Percentage: 1%
Overall Materiality: $250,000

Performance Materiality: 75% of Overall
Amount: $187,500

Posting Threshold: 5% of Overall
Amount: $12,500

Qualitative Factors Considered:
- Surety requires unqualified opinion
- Bank covenant requires 1.25 current ratio
- First year audit - increased risk
```

## Audit Strategy

### Substantive vs. Control Testing

| Approach | When Appropriate |
|----------|------------------|
| Primarily Substantive | Small company, weak controls |
| Combined | Larger company, good controls |
| Control Reliance | Sophisticated systems, strong controls |

### Key Audit Areas by Cycle

```
Revenue Cycle:
- Contract Revenue (POC/Over Time)
- Billings to Customers
- Accounts Receivable
- Retainage Receivable
- Claims and Change Orders

Cost Cycle:
- Job Costs (Labor, Materials, Subs)
- Cost Estimates
- Work in Process
- Accounts Payable
- Subcontractor Retainage

Equipment Cycle:

Financing Cycle:
- Debt and Credit Lines

```

## Planning Procedures

### Analytical Procedures

**Industry Metrics Analysis:**
| Metric | Calculation | Expected Range |
