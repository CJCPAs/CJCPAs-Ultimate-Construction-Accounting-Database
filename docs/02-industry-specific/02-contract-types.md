# Contract Types in Construction

## Overview

Understanding contract types is essential for proper revenue recognition, risk assessment, and financial reporting. Each contract type allocates risk differently between owner and contractor.

## Fixed-Price (Lump Sum) Contracts

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Price | Predetermined total amount |
| Risk Bearer | Contractor bears cost risk |
| Profit Potential | Higher if costs controlled |
| Owner Benefit | Budget certainty |
| Scope | Well-defined specifications |

### Variations

#### Firm Fixed-Price
- No price adjustment regardless of costs
- Highest risk to contractor
- Used when scope is well-defined

#### Fixed-Price with Economic Adjustment
- Price adjusted for inflation indices
- Common in long-duration contracts
- Reduces contractor risk

#### Fixed-Price Incentive
- Base price with incentive for savings/penalties for overruns
- Sharing formula (e.g., 50/50 savings sharing)
- Motivates efficiency

### Revenue Recognition

**Percentage of Completion:**
```
Contract Price: $5,000,000
Total Estimated Costs: $4,250,000
Costs to Date: $2,550,000
Percent Complete: 60%

Earned Revenue: $5,000,000 × 60% = $3,000,000
Gross Profit to Date: $3,000,000 - $2,550,000 = $450,000
```

### Risk Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Cost overruns | Thorough estimating, contingencies |
| Scope creep | Clear specifications, change order process |
| Inflation | Escalation clauses, hedge materials |
| Schedule delays | Liquidated damages caps, float management |

## Cost-Plus Contracts

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Price | Actual costs plus fee |
| Risk Bearer | Owner bears cost risk |
| Profit | Guaranteed fee or percentage |
| Owner Benefit | Flexibility, transparency |
| Scope | May be undefined or evolving |

### Types of Cost-Plus Contracts

#### Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)

```
Reimbursable Costs: $3,500,000
Fixed Fee: $250,000
Total Price: $3,750,000

Fee recognized proportionally:
- If 70% complete on cost basis
- Fee Recognized: $250,000 × 70% = $175,000
```

#### Cost Plus Percentage of Cost (CPPC)

```
Reimbursable Costs: $3,500,000
Fee Percentage: 8%
Fee: $280,000
Total Price: $3,780,000

As costs increase, fee increases proportionally
```

#### Cost Plus with Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP)

```
GMP: $4,000,000
Actual Costs: $3,400,000
Contractor Fee (10%): $340,000
Total Cost + Fee: $3,740,000

Savings: $4,000,000 - $3,740,000 = $260,000
Savings Split (50/50): $130,000 to each party

Contractor Total: $340,000 + $130,000 = $470,000
```

### Allowable vs. Non-Allowable Costs

| Allowable | Non-Allowable |
|-----------|---------------|
| Direct labor | Fines and penalties |
| Materials | Entertainment |
| Subcontracts | Alcoholic beverages |
| Equipment | Charitable donations |
| Supervision | Bad debts |
| Job site costs | Interest (usually) |
| Permits | Advertising |

### Revenue Recognition

For cost-plus contracts:
```
Revenue = Allowable Costs + Fee Earned

Example - CPFF at 70% Complete:
Costs Incurred: $2,450,000
Fee Earned: $175,000
Revenue: $2,625,000
```

## Time and Materials (T&M) Contracts

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Price | Hourly rates + material markup |
| Risk Bearer | Owner bears cost risk |
| Use Case | Undefined scope, emergency work |
| Documentation | Detailed time and material records |

```
Units Completed: 48,500 CY
Unit Price: $12.00
Revenue: $582,000

Or if cost-to-cost method used:
- Estimate total units and costs
- Apply percentage of completion
```

## Design-Build Contracts

### Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scope | Design and construction combined |
| Risk | Contractor bears design risk |
| Price | Often GMP or fixed-price |
| Performance Obligations | May be single or multiple |

### Revenue Recognition Considerations

**Single Performance Obligation:**
If design and construction highly interrelated:
- Combined as single obligation
- Revenue over time using percentage complete

**Multiple Performance Obligations:**
If design is distinct:
- Allocate price to each obligation
- Recognize design revenue separately

## Contract Combinations and Modifications

### Combining Contracts

Combine contracts if negotiated as package with:
- Single commercial objective
- Interrelated pricing
- Single performance obligation

### Modifications

| Type | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| Separate Contract | New distinct goods/services at standalone price |
| Cumulative Catch-up | Change to existing contract, not distinct |
| Prospective | Distinct goods/services, not standalone price |

## Contract Risk Assessment Matrix

| Contract Type | Cost Risk | Schedule Risk | Profit Certainty | Audit Risk |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Firm Fixed-Price | High | High | Low | High |
| Fixed-Price Incentive | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Cost Plus Fixed Fee | Low | Medium | High | Low |
| Cost Plus Percentage | Very Low | Low | Medium | Low |
| GMP | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| T&M | Very Low | Very Low | High | Low |
| Unit Price | Medium | Low | Medium | Medium |

## Accounting Policy Considerations

### Key Policy Decisions

1. **Input vs. Output Method:** How to measure progress
2. **Treatment of Uninstalled Materials:** Include or exclude from percentage
3. **Variable Consideration:** When to include in transaction price
4. **Combining vs. Segmenting:** Contract analysis methodology
5. **Change Order Recognition:** Timing of inclusion

### Sample Accounting Policy

```
Revenue Recognition Policy

The Company recognizes revenue from construction contracts over time as
performance obligations are satisfied. Progress is measured using the
cost-to-cost method, which the Company believes best depicts transfer of
control to customers.

For fixed-price contracts, the transaction price is the contract amount
adjusted for approved change orders and estimated variable consideration
that is not constrained.

For cost-plus contracts, revenue equals allowable costs incurred plus
earned fee. The Company uses the practical expedient to recognize revenue
equal to the amount it has the right to invoice when the invoiced amount
corresponds directly to the value delivered.

Uninstalled materials are excluded from the measure of progress unless
specifically fabricated for the project.
