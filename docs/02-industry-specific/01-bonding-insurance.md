# Bonding and Insurance in Construction

## Overview

Surety bonds and insurance are critical requirements for construction companies. Understanding these requirements is essential for contractors, and auditors must verify proper accounting and disclosure.

## Surety Bonds

### What is a Surety Bond?

A surety bond is a three-party agreement:
1. **Principal:** The contractor obligated to perform
2. **Obligee:** The owner who receives protection
3. **Surety:** The bonding company guaranteeing performance

Unlike insurance, the surety expects no loss. If a claim occurs, the surety has recourse against the contractor.

### Types of Construction Bonds

|---------|-------------|
| Purpose | Guarantees contractor will complete project per contract |
| Amount | Typically 100% of contract amount |
| When Required | At contract execution |

- Performance bond: 100% of contract value
- Payment bond: 100% of contract value (up to $5M), scaled above

### Little Miller Acts

State equivalents requiring bonds on public projects. Requirements vary by state.

## Bonding Capacity

### Factors Determining Capacity

| Factor | Weight | Optimal Range |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Working Capital | High | Current ratio > 1.5 |
| Net Worth | High | Adequate for project size |
| Backlog | Medium | Manageable relative to capacity |
| Banking Relationships | Medium | Strong line of credit |
| Experience | High | Proven track record |
| Equipment | Medium | Adequate for project type |
| Key Personnel | High | Qualified management |
| Accounting System | Medium | Reliable job costing |

### Working Capital Analysis

```
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Key Ratios:
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- Quick Ratio = (Cash + Receivables) / Current Liabilities

Bonding Rule of Thumb:
- Single job limit: 10-15× working capital
- Aggregate limit: 20-30× working capital
```

### Sample Bonding Capacity Calculation

```
BONDING CAPACITY ANALYSIS

Current Assets:
  Cash                           $   850,000
  Accounts Receivable             2,400,000
  Contract Assets (Underbillings)   650,000
  Inventory                         175,000
  Total Current Assets           $4,075,000

Current Liabilities:
  Accounts Payable               $1,200,000
  Contract Liabilities              280,000
  Accrued Expenses                  425,000
  Current Portion - LTD             150,000
  Total Current Liabilities      $2,055,000

Working Capital                  $2,020,000
Current Ratio                    1.98

Estimated Single Job Capacity: $2,020,000 × 12 = $24,240,000
Estimated Aggregate Capacity: $2,020,000 × 25 = $50,500,000
