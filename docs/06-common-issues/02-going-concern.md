# Going Concern Assessment for Construction Companies

## Overview

Going concern assessment is particularly important for construction companies due to the industry's cyclical nature, dependence on bonding, and project-based revenue recognition.

## Going Concern Framework

### Definition

Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events indicate it is probable an entity will be unable to meet obligations as they become due within one year after financial statement issuance.

### Management's Responsibility

- Evaluate conditions and events
- Consider management's plans
- Provide appropriate disclosures

### Auditor's Responsibility

- Evaluate management's assessment
- Consider audit evidence
- Evaluate disclosure adequacy
- Determine report implications

## Quantitative Analysis

### Working Capital Analysis

```
WORKING CAPITAL ASSESSMENT

                        Year 1    Year 2    Year 3    Current
Current Assets         $4.2M     $3.8M     $3.5M     $3.0M

Current Ratio          1.40      1.19      1.03      0.86

Trend Analysis:
- Working capital has declined each year
- Current ratio now below 1.0
- SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT INDICATOR
```

### Cash Flow Analysis

```
CASH FLOW ASSESSMENT

```

### Debt Analysis

```
DEBT COVENANT ASSESSMENT

Covenant Requirements:
- Minimum Working Capital: $500,000
- Minimum Current Ratio: 1.25
- Maximum Debt to Equity: 2.5

Actual Results:
- Working Capital: ($500,000) - VIOLATION
- Current Ratio: 0.86 - VIOLATION  
- Debt to Equity: 3.2 - VIOLATION

Status: Multiple covenant violations exist
        Bank has issued waiver through 6/30/25

```

## Disclosure Requirements

### When Substantial Doubt Exists

Required disclosures:
- Principal conditions or events
- Management's evaluation
- Management's plans
- Whether substantial doubt alleviated

### Sample Going Concern Disclosure

```
NOTE X - GOING CONCERN

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming 
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in 
the financial statements, the Company has a working capital 
deficiency of $500,000, experienced negative cash flows from 
operations of $400,000, and is in violation of certain debt 
covenants. These factors raise substantial doubt about the 
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Management has taken the following actions to address these 
conditions:
- Obtained a waiver of covenant violations through June 30, 2025
- Entered into agreement to sell excess equipment for $350,000
- Implemented cost reduction measures expected to save $200,000 
  annually
- Accelerated collection efforts on outstanding receivables

Management believes these actions will provide sufficient 
liquidity to meet obligations as they become due for at least 
one year from the financial statement issuance date. However, 
there can be no assurance that management's plans will be 
successfully implemented.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments that 
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
```

## Audit Report Implications

### Report Modifications

| Situation | Report Treatment |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Doubt alleviated by plans | Unmodified, emphasis possible |
| Doubt remains, disclosure adequate | Unmodified with emphasis |
| Doubt remains, disclosure inadequate | Qualified or adverse |
| Liquidation imminent | Different basis of accounting |

### Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraph

```
GOING CONCERN EMPHASIS PARAGRAPH

Emphasis of Matter

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared 
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As 
discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company 
has experienced declining working capital, negative operating 
cash flows, and debt covenant violations that raise substantial 
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. 
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also 
described in Note X. The financial statements do not include 
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this 
uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to 
this matter.
```

## Construction Industry Considerations

### Bonding Impact

- Loss of bonding can be fatal
- Unable to bid public work
- May lose existing contracts
- Consider disclosure even if doubt alleviated

### Backlog Considerations

- Declining backlog reduces future revenue
- Quality of backlog matters
- Bonded vs. non-bonded work
- Profit margins in backlog

### Seasonal Factors

- Construction often seasonal
- Winter cash flow challenges
- Consider twelve-month period
- Evaluate seasonal financing
