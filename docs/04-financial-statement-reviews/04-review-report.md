INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT'S REVIEW REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
XYZ Construction Company
Anytown, USA

We have reviewed the accompanying financial statements of XYZ 
Construction Company, which comprise the balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2024, and the related statements of income, changes 
in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, 
and the related notes to the financial statements. A review 
includes primarily applying analytical procedures to management's 
financial data and making inquiries of company management. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit, the objective 
of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial 
statements as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such 
an opinion.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation 
of these financial statements in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America; 
this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of 
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement 
whether due to fraud or error.

Accountant's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to conduct the review engagement in 
accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review 
Services promulgated by the Accounting and Review Services 
Committee of the AICPA. Those standards require us to perform 
procedures to obtain limited assurance as a basis for reporting 
whether we are aware of any material modifications that should 
be made to the financial statements for them to be in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. We believe that the results of our procedures 
provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion.

We are required to be independent of XYZ Construction Company and 
to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with 
the relevant ethical requirements related to our review.

Accountant's Conclusion

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications 
that should be made to the accompanying financial statements in 
order for them to be in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.

## Modified Review Reports

### Departures from GAAP

When financial statements contain a GAAP departure:

```
MODIFIED REVIEW REPORT - GAAP DEPARTURE

[Standard paragraphs through Accountant's Responsibility]

Basis for Qualified Conclusion

As disclosed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company 
recognizes revenue from long-term construction contracts using the 
completed contract method. Accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America require that revenue from such 
contracts be recognized over time using a method that depicts 
transfer of control. The effects of this departure from accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America on 
the financial statements have not been determined.

Qualified Conclusion

Based on our review, except for the effects of the matter described 
in the Basis for Qualified Conclusion paragraph, we are not aware 
of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying 
financial statements in order for them to be in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America.

### Going Concern

When substantial doubt about going concern exists:

```
REVIEW REPORT - GOING CONCERN

[Standard paragraphs through Accountant's Conclusion]

Emphasis-of-Matter Regarding Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming 
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed 
in Note X to the financial statements, the Company has experienced 
recurring losses from operations, has a working capital deficiency, 
and has experienced a reduction in bonding capacity. These conditions 
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as 
a going concern. Management's plans regarding these matters are 
described in Note X. The financial statements do not include any 
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
Our conclusion is not modified with respect to this matter.

[Signature, City, Date]
```

### Emphasis of Matter

When accountant wants to emphasize a matter:

```
REVIEW REPORT - EMPHASIS OF MATTER

[Standard paragraphs through Accountant's Conclusion]

Emphasis of Matter

As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company 
has significant pending claims against project owners totaling 
$1,200,000. The ultimate outcome of these claims cannot presently 
be determined. Our conclusion is not modified with respect to 
this matter.
