# Financial Statement Review Overview

## Introduction

A financial statement review provides limited assurance that there are no material modifications needed for financial statements to conform with GAAP. Reviews are less extensive than audits but more involved than compilations.

## Applicable Standards

### SSARS Framework

Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) govern reviews:
- **SSARS No. 21:** Clarification and recodification

### Level of Assurance

| Engagement | Assurance Level | Report Language |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Audit | Reasonable | "In our opinion" |
| Review | Limited | "Not aware of material modifications" |
| Compilation | None | No assurance provided |
