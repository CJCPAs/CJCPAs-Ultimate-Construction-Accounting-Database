# Analytical Procedures for Construction Reviews

## Overview

Analytical procedures are essential to review engagements. For construction companies, these procedures focus on industry-specific metrics and relationships that may indicate misstatements.

## Types of Analytical Procedures

### Trend Analysis

Compare current period to prior periods:

| Metric | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| Revenue | Year-over-year change |
| Gross Profit | Margin trends |
| Over/Underbillings | Period-to-period change |
| Backlog | Trend over time |
| Working Capital | Liquidity trend |

### Ratio Analysis

Calculate and evaluate key ratios:

```
CONSTRUCTION RATIO ANALYSIS

Profitability Ratios:
- Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue
- Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue
- Return on Assets = Net Income / Total Assets
- Return on Equity = Net Income / Equity

Liquidity Ratios:
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- Quick Ratio = (Cash + Receivables) / Current Liabilities
- Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Activity Ratios:
- Days Sales Outstanding = (A/R / Revenue) × 365
- Days Payables Outstanding = (A/P / Cost of Revenue) × 365
- Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets

Leverage Ratios:
- Debt to Equity = Total Debt / Equity
- Debt to Assets = Total Debt / Total Assets
```

### Reasonableness Testing

Evaluate whether balances are reasonable:

| Test | Calculation |
|------|-------------|
| Labor Cost | Hours × Rate comparison |
| Material Cost | Quantity × Price comparison |
| Equipment Cost | Hours × Rate verification |
| Revenue | % Complete × Contract Price |

## Construction-Specific Analytics

### WIP Schedule Analysis

```
WIP SCHEDULE ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

1. Overall Metrics
   - Total contracts: Compare to prior year
   - Total revenue: Trend analysis
   - Average gross profit %: Compare to expectations
   - Net over/underbillings: Trend and reasonableness

2. Contract-Level Analysis
   - Contracts with unusual margins (>25% or <5%)
   - Contracts with significant estimate changes
   - Contracts near completion (>90%)
   - Contracts with large underbillings

3. Relationship Testing
   - Costs to date vs. billings pattern
   - Earned revenue vs. prior estimates
   - Over/underbillings vs. completion %
```

### Gross Profit Analysis

```
GROSS PROFIT MARGIN BY CONTRACT TYPE

                      Prior Year   Current Year   Change
Fixed Price           14.2%        13.8%          (0.4%)
Cost Plus             11.5%        12.0%           0.5%
T&M                   18.5%        17.2%          (1.3%)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall               13.8%        13.5%          (0.3%)

Analysis:
- Fixed price margin decline: Inquire about cost overruns
- T&M margin decline: Review billing rates
- Overall decline: Consider market conditions
```

### Backlog Analysis

```
BACKLOG TREND ANALYSIS

                    Q1        Q2        Q3        Q4
Beginning Backlog   $18.0M    $20.5M    $22.0M    $19.5M
New Contracts       +$8.5M    +$7.2M    +$4.8M    +$6.2M
Revenue Earned      ($6.0M)   ($5.7M)   ($7.3M)   ($6.8M)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ending Backlog      $20.5M    $22.0M    $19.5M    $18.9M

Analysis:
- Q3 large completions reduced backlog
- Q4 new contracts offsetting completion
- Inquire about sales pipeline for next year
```

### Over/Underbilling Analysis

```
OVER/UNDERBILLING TREND

                    Year 1    Year 2    Year 3    Current
Underbillings       $425K     $380K     $520K     $750K
Overbillings       ($180K)   ($220K)   ($310K)   ($375K)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Net Underbillings   $245K     $160K     $210K     $375K
As % of Revenue     2.1%      1.3%      1.5%      2.1%

Analysis:
- Net underbillings increasing
- May indicate:
  * Billing delays
  * Revenue recognition issues
  * Cash flow implications
- Inquire about billing practices
```

## Expectations Development

### Developing Expectations

Before analyzing results, develop expectations:

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Prior Year | Historical patterns |
| Industry | Average margins, ratios |
| Backlog | Expected revenue from contracts |
| Economy | Market conditions |
| Management Plans | Growth initiatives |

### Example Expectation

```
REVENUE EXPECTATION DEVELOPMENT

Beginning Backlog:              $18,900,000
Plus: Expected New Contracts:   +$8,000,000
Total Available:                $26,900,000

Expected Completion Rate:       65%
Expected Revenue:               $17,485,000

Actual Revenue:                 $18,266,875
Variance:                       $781,875 (4.5% favorable)

Assessment: Within acceptable range
            Inquire about additional contracts won
```

## Investigating Variances

### Threshold for Inquiry

| Metric | Inquiry Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|
| Revenue Change | >10% unexplained |
| Gross Margin Change | >2 percentage points |
| Ratio Change | >15% from prior year |
| Balance Change | >Materiality threshold |

### Inquiry Process

When variance identified:

1. **Calculate Variance:** Quantify the difference
2. **Consider Explanations:** Develop hypotheses
3. **Inquire of Management:** Ask specific questions
4. **Evaluate Response:** Assess reasonableness
5. **Document Conclusion:** Record inquiry and response

### Sample Inquiry Documentation

```
ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE DOCUMENTATION

Account/Metric: Gross Profit Margin
Expectation: 14.0% (prior year actual)
Actual: 12.8%
Variance: 1.2 percentage points (unfavorable)

Potential Causes:
1. Cost overruns on specific projects
2. Competitive pricing pressure
3. Material cost increases
4. Labor inefficiencies

Inquiry Made: Discussed with CFO on 2/15/25

Management Response:
"Material costs increased approximately 8% due to supply 
chain issues. We were unable to pass all increases to 
customers on fixed-price contracts. Additionally, labor 
costs increased due to overtime on two projects that 
experienced delays."

Assessment: Explanation appears reasonable and consistent 
with economic conditions. No further procedures required.
