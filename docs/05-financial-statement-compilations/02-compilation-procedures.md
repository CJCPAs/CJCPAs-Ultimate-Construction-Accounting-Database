# Compilation Procedures for Construction Companies

## Overview

While compilations do not require assurance procedures, the accountant must apply accounting and financial reporting expertise to assist management in presenting financial statements properly.

## Understanding the Construction Business

### Industry Knowledge

For construction company compilations, understand:

| Area | Knowledge Required |
|------|-------------------|
| Contract Types | Fixed-price, cost-plus, T&M, unit price |
| Revenue Recognition | POC method, input measures, ASC 606 |
| Job Costing | Cost accumulation, allocation methods |
| Billing Practices | Progress billing, retainage |
| Regulatory | Prevailing wage, licensing, bonding |

### Entity-Specific Understanding

```

## Compiling the WIP Schedule

## Compiling Financial Statements

### Balance Sheet Considerations

Construction-specific items to address:

| Account | Compilation Consideration |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Contract Assets | Underbillings from WIP |
| Retainage Receivable | Separately presented |
| Contract Liabilities | Overbillings from WIP |
| Retainage Payable | Separately presented |
| Equipment | Proper depreciation |

### Income Statement Considerations

| Account | Compilation Consideration |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Contract Revenue | Per WIP calculation |
| Cost of Revenue | Direct job costs |
| Gross Profit | By job if supplementary |
| Equipment Income | Internal charges |

### Cash Flow Considerations

- Operating cash flow from construction operations
- Significant equipment purchases
- Debt activity
- Equity transactions

## Reading the Financial Statements

### Required Reading

The accountant must read compiled statements to consider:
- Appropriate form
- Free from obvious errors
- Mathematically accurate
- Notes adequate (unless omitted)

### Construction-Specific Review

When reading construction financial statements:

```
READING CHECKLIST

Format and Presentation:
□ Appropriate financial statement titles
□ Proper period identification
□ Consistent terminology
□ Appropriate classifications

Contract Assets and Liabilities:
□ Underbillings properly classified as current
□ Overbillings properly classified as current
□ Retainage separately identified

Revenue Recognition:
□ Gross profit margins reasonable
□ No unusual fluctuations unexplained
□ Loss contracts addressed

Mathematical Accuracy:
□ Statements foot and crossfoot
□ WIP ties to financial statements
□ Retained earnings rolls forward

Notes (if included):
□ Revenue recognition policy disclosed
□ Significant estimates discussed
□ Related parties disclosed
□ Commitments and contingencies addressed
```

## When Something Looks Wrong

### Accountant's Responsibility

If accountant becomes aware information may be:
- Incorrect
- Incomplete
- Misleading

**Required Actions:**
1. Obtain additional information
2. Request management revise information
3. If not revised, consider effect on report
4. May need to withdraw from engagement

### Common Construction Issues

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Unrealistic margins | Request support for estimates |
| Missing contracts | Inquire about completeness |
| Stale receivables | Consider collectibility |
| GAAP departures | Disclose in report |
