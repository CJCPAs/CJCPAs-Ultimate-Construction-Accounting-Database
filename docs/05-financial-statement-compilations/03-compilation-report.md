INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT'S COMPILATION REPORT

To Management
XYZ Construction Company

We have compiled the accompanying financial statements of XYZ 
Construction Company, which comprise the balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2024, and the related statements of income, changes 
in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, 
and the related notes to the financial statements in accordance 
with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services 
issued by the Accounting and Review Services Committee of the AICPA.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation 
of these financial statements in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America; 
this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of 
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

Accountant's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to conduct the compilation in accordance 
with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services 
issued by the Accounting and Review Services Committee of the AICPA. 
The objective of a compilation is to assist management in presenting 
financial information in the form of financial statements without 
undertaking to obtain or provide any assurance that there are no 
material modifications that should be made to the financial 
statements.

Accountant's Compilation Report

We did not audit or review the financial statements nor were we 
required to perform any procedures to verify the accuracy or 
completeness of the information provided by management. We do 
not express an opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any form of 
assurance on these financial statements.

## Modified Compilation Reports

### Lack of Independence

```
COMPILATION REPORT - NOT INDEPENDENT

[Standard paragraphs through Accountant's Compilation Report]

We are not independent with respect to XYZ Construction Company.

[Signature]
[City, State]
[Date]
```

With reason disclosed:

```
We are not independent with respect to XYZ Construction Company 
because the owner of the firm has a direct financial interest 
in the Company.
```

### Substantially All Disclosures Omitted

```
COMPILATION REPORT - DISCLOSURES OMITTED

[Standard paragraphs through Accountant's Responsibility]

Accountant's Compilation Report

Management has elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures 
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. If the omitted disclosures were included in the 
financial statements, they might influence the user's conclusions 
about the Company's financial position, results of operations, and 
cash flows. Accordingly, the financial statements are not designed 
for those who are not informed about such matters.

We did not audit or review the financial statements nor were we 
required to perform any procedures to verify the accuracy or 
completeness of the information provided by management. We do 
not express an opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any form of 
assurance on these financial statements.

### GAAP Departure

[Standard paragraphs through Accountant's Responsibility]

Accountant's Compilation Report

We did not audit or review the financial statements nor were we 
required to perform any procedures to verify the accuracy or 
completeness of the information provided by management. We do 
not express an opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any form of 
assurance on these financial statements.

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America require that revenue from long-term construction contracts 
be recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method. 
As disclosed in Note X, management has elected to use the completed 
contract method for these financial statements. The effects of 
this departure on the financial statements have not been determined.

### Going Concern

If accountant believes there is substantial doubt about going concern:

```
COMPILATION REPORT - GOING CONCERN

[Standard paragraphs through Accountant's Compilation Report]

Emphasis of Matter

As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, the Company 
has experienced recurring losses from operations and has a working 
capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about 
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's 
evaluation of the events and conditions and management's plans 
regarding these matters are described in Note X. The financial 
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from 
the outcome of this uncertainty.

When compiling WIP schedule as supplementary information:

```
COMPILATION REPORT WITH SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

[Standard compilation report paragraphs]

Supplementary Information

The supplementary schedule of work in progress is presented for 
purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of 
the basic financial statements. This schedule is the representation 
of management. The schedule was compiled from information provided 
by management. We have not audited or reviewed the supplementary 
information and do not express an opinion, a conclusion, nor 
provide any assurance on such information.

## Special Purpose Frameworks

### Tax Basis Financial Statements

```
COMPILATION REPORT - TAX BASIS

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT'S COMPILATION REPORT

[Addressee]

We have compiled the accompanying financial statements of XYZ 
Construction Company, which comprise the statement of assets, 
liabilities, and equity - tax basis as of December 31, 2024, 
and the related statement of revenues and expenses - tax basis 
for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial 
statements in accordance with Statements on Standards for 
Accounting and Review Services issued by the Accounting and 
Review Services Committee of the AICPA.

[Management's Responsibility and Accountant's Responsibility - 
reference to tax basis of accounting]

Accountant's Compilation Report

We did not audit or review the financial statements nor were we 
required to perform any procedures to verify the accuracy or 
completeness of the information provided by management. We do 
not express an opinion, a conclusion, nor provide any form of 
assurance on these financial statements.

We draw your attention to Note X of the financial statements, 
which describes the basis of accounting. The financial statements 
are prepared on the basis of accounting the Company uses for 
income tax purposes, which is a basis of accounting other than 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America.
