# Financial Statement Compilation Overview

## Introduction

A compilation is the most basic level of service an accountant can provide with respect to financial statements. The accountant assists management in presenting financial information without providing any assurance on the statements.

## Applicable Standards

### SSARS Framework

Compilations are governed by:
- **AR-C Section 80:** Compilation Engagements
- **AR-C Section 60:** General Principles

### Level of Service

| Service | Assurance | Independence Required |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Audit | Reasonable | Yes |
| Review | Limited | Yes |
| Compilation | None | No (with disclosure) |
| Preparation | None | No |

## Independence Considerations

### Independence Not Required

Unlike audits and reviews, independence is NOT required for compilations. However:

**If Independent:**
- Standard compilation report used
- No special disclosure needed

**If Not Independent:**
- Must disclose lack of independence
- May disclose reason (not required)
- Cannot perform review or audit

### Sample Independence Disclosure

```
We are not independent with respect to XYZ Construction Company.
```

Or with reason:

```
We are not independent with respect to XYZ Construction Company 
because the firm's partner has a direct financial interest in 
the Company.
```

### Material Departure Disclosure

```
COMPILATION REPORT WITH GAAP DEPARTURE

[Standard paragraphs]

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America require that revenue from long-term construction 
contracts be recognized over time using the percentage-of-
completion method. As disclosed in Note X, management has elected 
to use the completed contract method for financial reporting 
purposes. The effects of this departure on the financial 
statements have not been determined.
```

## Omission of Disclosures

### Substantially All Disclosures Omitted

Compilations may omit substantially all disclosures if:
- Omission clearly indicated in report
- Omission not intended to mislead users
- Management informed of omission

### Modified Report for Omitted Disclosures

```
Management has elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures 
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America. If the omitted disclosures were included 
in the financial statements, they might influence the user's 
conclusions about the company's financial position, results of 
operations, and cash flows. Accordingly, the financial statements 
are not designed for those who are not informed about such matters.
```

## Supplementary Information

### WIP Schedule

The WIP schedule may be compiled as supplementary information:
- Compiled along with financial statements
- Or provided separately
- Report should address supplementary information

### Report on Supplementary Information

```
The supplementary information contained in the schedule of work 
in progress is presented for purposes of additional analysis and 
is not a required part of the basic financial statements. The 
information is the representation of management and was compiled 
from information provided by management without audit or review.
```

## Uses of Compilations

### When Appropriate

Compilations are commonly used for:
- Small construction companies
- Internal management purposes
- Tax planning
- Limited bank requirements

### Limitations
