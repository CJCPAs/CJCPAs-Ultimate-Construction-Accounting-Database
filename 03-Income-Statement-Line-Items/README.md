| General Contractor | 8-15% |
| Heavy/Civil | 10-18% |
| Specialty Trade | 15-25% |
| Residential | 15-25% |

### Operating Margin

```
                        Operating Income
Operating Margin % = ────────────────────── × 100
                       Contract Revenue
```

**Industry Benchmark:** 2-8%

---

### Net Profit Margin

```
                    Net Income

## Cost of Revenue vs. G&A: Critical Distinction

### What Goes to Cost of Revenue (Direct/Job Costs)

**Rule:** If the cost can be directly traced to a specific job, it's a direct cost.

| Cost Type | Direct (COR) | Indirect (G&A) |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Field labor working on job | ✓ | |
| Superintendent on multiple jobs | | ✓ |
| Materials installed on job | ✓ | |
| Office supplies | | ✓ |
| Subcontractor on job | ✓ | |
| Equipment used on job | ✓ | |
| Equipment depreciation (pool) | | ✓ |
| Job-specific insurance | ✓ | |
| General liability insurance | | ✓ |
| Job trailer rental | ✓ | |
| Office rent | | ✓ |

---

### Why Proper Classification Matters

1. **Accurate Job Costing:** Need true direct costs for WIP calculations
2. **Gross Profit Analysis:** GP% only meaningful with proper classification
3. **Bonding/Surety:** Sureties analyze cost structure
4. **Bidding:** Markup applied to direct costs
5. **Tax:** Some costs have different tax treatment

---

## Revenue Recognition Summary

### The Key Calculation

```
Revenue = % Complete × Total Contract Price

where:

                   Costs Incurred to Date
% Complete = ─────────────────────────────────
              Total Estimated Contract Costs
```

### Revenue Does NOT Equal:
- Cash received
- Billings issued
- Contracts signed

### Revenue EQUALS:
- Work performed and earned
- Based on input or output methods
- Recognized over time
